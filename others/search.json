The expedition itself (the looking at nature, the walking) was wonderful, even without seeing the snow leopard. The monk’s “Isn’t that wonderful!” when they found nothing showed release from attachment.\n\n“Is it at odds with self-interest?”\n\nReply: Spinoza would say it’s a necessary condition for a truly fulfilling life, bringing equanimity and joy.\n\n\n\n\nModern thinking: Think about climate change or conservation. An “eternal perspective” acknowledges our tiny place in a vast, ongoing system and encourages actions that benefit future generations or the planet, not just immediate personal gain."

Mention that examples come from history, literature, and modern life."

    "section": "1) Be self-constituted",
    "text": "1) Be self-constituted\nMain idea: Build a stable, honest character and stick to it.\nWhy it matters: If you have clear values, you are less likely to be pushed around or make harmful choices.\nShort example: Huckleberry Finn tries to do what feels right for everyone on the raft, showing kindness and fairness.\n\nTalk about what “self-constituted” means: being guided by your chosen moral rules, not just impulses. Point out the risk: someone can be self-constituted but selfish, so the values must be kind and fair."

    "text": "2) Keep awake and aware\nMain idea: Don’t “sleepwalk” through life; pay attention to what you do and why you do it.\nWhy it matters: Important decisions made without awareness can cause big harm.\nReal case: Leaders before World War I acted without truly understanding the risks, and that led to disaster.\n\nGive a simple definition of “sleepwalking” as acting without thinking about causes and consequences. Encourage students to pause before big choices and check their reasons."

    "section": "5) Seek an eternal perspective",
    "text": "5) Seek an eternal perspective\nMain idea: Try to see life from a broader viewpoint — beyond small, intense worries.\nWhy it matters: A wide view can bring calm and let you enjoy the present without being crushed by failure or desire.\nExample: A monk who didn’t see failure in not spotting a snow leopard, but found the whole trip wonderful.\n\n\nStoicism\n\nThink about death to reduce fear.\nPractice self-control.\n\n\nSpinoza-style\n\nSeek compassion without attachment.\nFind joy by understanding nature and life.\n\n\n\nUse the column slide to compare two ways of gaining calm: Stoic training and broader, compassionate views. Ask students: Which fits you more, preparing for hard events or expanding what you care about?"

    "section": "6) Guard against self-deception",
    "text": "6) Guard against self-deception\nMain idea: Be careful that your feelings or wishes don’t trick you into believing false things.\nWhy it matters: Smart people can fool themselves by only noticing facts that match what they already believe.\nWarning sign: If you only read or listen to people who agree with you, you may be trapped by confirmation bias.\n\nGive a quick activity: ask students to list one belief they feel sure about and then find one strong argument against it. Explain that checking yourself helps better decisions and relationships."

    "section": "7) How to confront mortality",
    "text": "7) How to confront mortality\nMain idea: Thinking about death calmly helps you live better and be less afraid.\nWhy it matters: When you accept that life ends, you can focus on what matters now and act kindly.\nExamples: Montaigne and Katherine Hepburn were calm about dying and focused on simple pleasures like gardening.\n\nEmphasize that the goal is not morbid worry but a healthy acceptance that encourages meaning. Suggest small practices: imagine what you’d want remembered about you, or write a short letter to family."

    "text": "9) Consider what you have at the moment\nMain idea: Notice and appreciate what you own and who you are with right now.\nWhy it matters: People often only notice good things after they’re gone.\nShakespeare line: We prize not what we have while we enjoy it, but when it’s lost we find its true value.\n\nEncourage a short classroom exercise: have students write down three things they often take for granted. Discuss how gratitude practices can improve mood and relationships."

    "text": "Quick “math” idea about Luck and Effort\n\\[ \\text{Outcome} = \\text{Skill} + \\text{Effort} + \\text{Luck} \\]\nInterpretation: Work hard and get better skills, but remember luck still helps a lot. Use this to stay humble and to help others when you can.\n\nExplain the equation as a simple way to think about success. Stress that it doesn’t remove the value of effort, but it adds perspective."
