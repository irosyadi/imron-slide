    "text": "First let’s define the six trig functions: sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cotangent and cosecant, and see what they have to do with triangles. The mnemonic SOH-CAH-TOA captures the definitions of the three most common trig functions, at least for angles in the first quadrant (between 0 and π/2 radians). You will need to know the following:\n\nSine = Opposite / Hypotenuse\n\\(\\displaystyle \\text{Sine}=\\frac{\\text{Opposite}}{\\text{Hypotenuse}}\\)\nCosine = Adjacent / Hypotenuse\n\\(\\displaystyle \\text{Cosine}=\\frac{\\text{Adjacent}}{\\text{Hypotenuse}}\\)\nTangent = Opposite / Adjacent\n\\(\\displaystyle \\text{Tangent}=\\frac{\\text{Opposite}}{\\text{Adjacent}}\\)\n\n\n\n\nRight triangle diagram\n\n\nThe other trig functions are defined as reciprocals of the first three, and below you will find the reciprocal relationships (which you need to know) as well as the resulting triangle relationships of the other three trig functions. You need not memorize the triangle relationships of these trig functions, as long as you know the reciprocal relationships. (The colorful diagram is interesting, but you need not worry about it.)\n\nSecant = 1 / Cosine = Hypotenuse / Adjacent\n\\(\\displaystyle \\text{Secant}=\\frac{1}{\\text{Cosine}}=\\frac{\\text{Hypotenuse}}{\\text{Adjacent}}\\)\nCosecant = 1 / Sine = Hypotenuse / Opposite\n\\(\\displaystyle \\text{Cosecant}=\\frac{1}{\\text{Sine}}=\\frac{\\text{Hypotenuse}}{\\text{Opposite}}\\)\nCotangent = 1 / Tangent = Adjacent / Opposite\n\\(\\displaystyle \\text{Cotangent}=\\frac{1}{\\text{Tangent}}=\\frac{\\text{Adjacent}}{\\text{Opposite}}\\)\n\n\n\n\nReciprocal trig diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext let’s see how these functions are related. These are identities you will need for calculus (there are many others you learned in your trig class that we generally do not use in calculus).\n\n\\(\\sin(-\\theta)=-\\sin(\\theta)\\)\n\n\\(\\cos(-\\theta)=+\\cos(\\theta)\\)\n\n\\(\\sin(2\\theta)=2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)\\)\n\n\\(\\sin^2(\\theta)+\\cos^2(\\theta)=1\\)\n\n\\(\\tan^2(\\theta)+1=\\sec^2(\\theta)\\)\n\n\\(1+\\cot^2(\\theta)=\\csc^2(\\theta)\\)\n\n\\(\\cos^2(\\theta)=\\frac{1+\\cos(2\\theta)}{2}\\)\n\n\\(\\sin^2(\\theta)=\\frac{1-\\cos(2\\theta)}{2}\\)\n\nThe first two say that sine is an odd function, and that cosine is an even function.\nDO: Play with positive and negative angles on the unit circle to see why the first two identities make sense.\nThe next three are called Pythagorean identities, since they’re all based on the Pythagorean theorem. Notice that if you take the primary Pythagorean identity, \\(\\sin^2(\\theta)+\\cos^2(\\theta)=1\\), and divide all terms by \\(\\cos^2(\\theta)\\) you get the tangent/secant Pythagorean identity. Similarly, if you divide all terms of the primary identity by \\(\\sin^2(\\theta)\\) you get the cotangent/cosecant identity. You need not memorize the last two since they are so easily computed.\nThe last two identities will be used to help compute integrals, during the second semester of calculus.\n\n\n\nYou should know the sines, cosines and tangents that come from 30-60-90 right triangles and isosceles right triangles.

The angle opposite the shorter leg (of length \\(1\\)) is \\(\\pi/6\\) and the angle opposite the longer leg (of length \\(\\sqrt{3}\\)) is \\(\\pi/3\\).

Hint: use the box above, where \\(f\\) is \\(g\\) here, \\(a\\) is \\(4\\) here, and \\(f(a)\\) is \\(g(4)\\) here.\nRemember, the point-slope formula \\(y-y_1=m(x-x_1)\\) is the best way to compute the equation of the tangent line, for reasons that will become apparent later, so practice with that form of the line (even if you have a preferred other method, such as plugging in a point to the slope-intercept form \\(y=mx+b\\).\nVideo: Tangent Line Equation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number which is the derivative of \\(f\\) at \\(x=a\\), denoted by \\(f'(a)\\), gives us the instantaneous rate of change of the function \\(f\\) with respect to \\(x\\) when \\(x=a\\).\nIf we are considering the graph of \\(f\\), \\(f'(a)\\) gives us the slope of the tangent line of \\(f\\) at $x=a`.\nDO: Learn: The derivative of a function at a point gives us the\n    instantaneous rate of change of that function at that point and the slope of the tangent line\n    of that function at that point.\nWarning: The definition of the derivative at a point is above. Some of the representations given by the derivative are in the paragraph immediately above, and these are not the definition.\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(f(t)\\) represents the length of a deer’s antler, in inches, on a given day in May, and \\(t\\) represents time in days (with 1 being the first day of May), what does \\(f'(10)=\\) represent? Try to think this through before reading on, including units in your answer.\n\\(f'(10)\\) should represent the rate of change of \\(f\\) on the day \\(t=10\\), so it is the rate of change of the length of the deer’s antler on May 10. So if \\(f'(10)=\\), the deer’s antler is growing at a rate of units on the 10th of May. The units are determined by the change in \\(f\\) divided by the change in \\(t\\), so the units are (units of \\(f\\))/(units of \\(t\\)). We see that the deer’s antler is growing at a rate of inches/day on the 10th of May.\nDo: Let \\(h(\\theta)\\) represent the height in meters of the end of a long ladder that is being raised, where \\(\\theta\\), measured in radians, represents the angle of the ladder to the (horizontal) ground. What does \\(h'(\\frac{\\pi}{6})=3\\) represent, including units?"

Hint: use the box above, where \\(f\\) is \\(g\\) here, \\(a\\) is \\(4\\) here, and \\(f(a)\\) is \\(g(4)\\) here.\nRemember, the point-slope formula \\(y-y_1=m(x-x_1)\\) is the best way to compute the equation of the tangent line, for reasons that will become apparent later, so practice with that form of the line (even if you have a preferred other method, such as plugging in a point to the slope-intercept form \\(y=mx+b\\).\nVideo: Tangent Line Equation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number which is the derivative of \\(f\\) at \\(x=a\\), denoted by \\(f'(a)\\), gives us the instantaneous rate of change of the function \\(f\\) with respect to \\(x\\) when \\(x=a\\).\nIf we are considering the graph of \\(f\\), \\(f'(a)\\) gives us the slope of the tangent line of \\(f\\) at $x=a`.\nDO: Learn: The derivative of a function at a point gives us the\n    instantaneous rate of change of that function at that point and the slope of the tangent line\n    of that function at that point.\nWarning: The definition of the derivative at a point is above. Some of the representations given by the derivative are in the paragraph immediately above, and these are not the definition.\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(f(t)\\) represents the length of a deer’s antler, in inches, on a given day in May, and \\(t\\) represents time in days (with 1 being the first day of May), what does \\(f'(10)=\\) represent? Try to think this through before reading on, including units in your answer.\n\\(f'(10)\\) should represent the rate of change of \\(f\\) on the day \\(t=10\\), so it is the rate of change of the length of the deer’s antler on May 10. So if \\(f'(10)=\\), the deer’s antler is growing at a rate of units on the 10th of May. The units are determined by the change in \\(f\\) divided by the change in \\(t\\), so the units are (units of \\(f\\))/(units of \\(t\\)). We see that the deer’s antler is growing at a rate of inches/day on the 10th of May.\nDo: Let \\(h(\\theta)\\) represent the height in meters of the end of a long ladder that is being raised, where \\(\\theta\\), measured in radians, represents the angle of the ladder to the (horizontal) ground. What does \\(h'(\\frac{\\pi}{6})=3\\) represent, including units?"

These laws are really theorems that have been proven, based on the technical definition of the limit.\n\n\nSuppose that \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)\\) and \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to a} g(x)\\) exist, and that \\(c\\) is a constant. Then: * The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits: \\(\\lim_{x \\to a} \\left(f(x)+g(x)\\right) = \\left(\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)\\right) + \\left(\\lim_{x \\to a} g(x)\\right).\\) * The limit of a difference is the difference of the limits: \\(\\lim_{x \\to a} \\left(f(x)-g(x)\\right) = \\left(\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)\\right) - \\left(\\lim_{x \\to a} g(x)\\right).\\) * The limit of a multiple is a multiple of the limit: \\(\\lim_{c \\to a} c \\cdot f(x) = c \\cdot \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x).\\) * The limit of a product is the product of the limits: \\(\\lim_{x \\to a} \\left(f(x)\\cdot g(x)\\right) = \\left(\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\lim_{x \\to a} g(x)\\right).\\) * The limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits as long as you are not dividing by zero: \\(\\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)}{\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to a} g(x)}, \\;\\text{ if }\\; \\lim_{x \\to a} g(x) \\ne 0.\\)\nNotice that the same rules apply to limits as \\(x \\to a^+\\) or \\(x \\to a^-\\).\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\frac{\\text{non-zero number}}{0}\\), when \\(g\\) is approaching zero but \\(f\\) is not?\nConsider the example where \\(f(x)\\) is close to 4 and \\(g(x)\\) is close to 0. It might be \\(\\frac{3.99}{} = 3990000\\), or it might be \\(\\frac{4.01}{-} = -4010000\\). Dividing by a number close to zero might give you a big positive ratio, or a big negative ratio. Without knowing more about \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\), you just can’t tell. What we do know is that if the denominator goes to zero and the numerator does not, we have a vertical asymptote, and the limit must be either \\(\\infty\\), \\(-\\infty\\) or it does not exist because the leftand right-hand limits do not agree. So \\(\\frac{\\text{non-zero number}}{0}\\) is not an indeterminate form – we know this limit value will be one of the values listed above. To determine which of the three is the value of the limit, we need only compute the leftand right-hand limits.\n\nWhat happens when the limit looks like \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\), when both \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) both approach zero and either could be positive or negative? In that case, \\(\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{\\hbox{ small number}}{\\hbox{small number}}.\\) This ratio could be \\(\\frac{}{} = 0.001,\\) or it could be \\(\\frac{}{} = 1000,\\) or it could be \\(\\frac{}{-0.000001} = -1000.\\) Without understanding the numerator and denominator better, we just can’t tell how limits of the form \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\) will behave. We’ll learn more about these kinds of limits; \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\) is an indeterminate form, which means that we cannot determine its value, or even make a good guess, without more effort. To evaluate indeterminate forms, we will do more work. At this point in the course, this means do algebra to change the form of \\(\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(f\\) is a polynomial or a rational function, and \\(a\\) is in the domain of \\(f\\), then \\(\\lim _{x\\to a} f(x)=f(a).\\)\nThis theorem is true by virtue of the earlier limit laws. By applying the product rule, we can get \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to a} x^n = a^n\\). Combining this with our rule for multiples and sums gives the theorem for polynomials. Combining that with our rule for quotients gives the theorem for rational functions.\nIn practice, the theorem says that whenever \\(f\\) is a polynomial or rational function, we can evaluate \\(f\\) at \\(a\\), and if this value exists, it is the limit as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\).\nFor example, if we wish to evaluate \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 3} (x^2-4),\\) we simply plug \\(3\\) into \\(x^2-4\\), getting 5. Another example: \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 4}\\frac{x-2}{x+2}=\\frac{4-2}{4+2}=\\frac{1}{3}.\\) The conclusion: if you plug \\(a\\) into \\(f\\) and there are no issues (dividing by zero, negative under a square root, etc.) most likely that is the limit value.\n\n\n\nIf \\(f(x) = g(x)\\) whenever \\(x \\ne a\\), then \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to a} g(x)\\).\nWhen \\(x\\) is close to \\(a\\) (but not equal to \\(a\\)), \\(g(x)=f(x)\\), so \\(g(x)\\) is close to whatever \\(f(x)\\) is close to. This seems like a trivial result, but it is very useful for evaluating limits of ratios where both the numerator and denominator go to zero. For instance \\((x^2-1)/(x-1) = x+1\\) whenever \\(x \\ne 1\\), so \\(\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2-1}{x-1} = \\lim_{x \\to 1} (x+1) = 1+1 = 2.\\)\nThe conclusion: If you can factor the top and bottom and cancel a factor from both, and the factor is zero at \\(x=a\\), then the original function and the function you did more work on are the same except at \\(x=a\\), so their limits are the same as \\(x\\to a\\). To restate slightly differently, notice that this limit was of the form \\(\\tfrac00\\), so we needed to do more work. The work we did was getting rid of common factors in the top and bottom, which we could do because of the second theorem above.\n\n\n\n\nFactoring can help us evaluate a limit. For example, we already looked at the limit \\(\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}\\) Since \\(x^2-1 = (x-1)(x+1)\\), we have \\(\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2-1}{x-1} = \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1} = \\lim_{x\\to 1} (x+1) = 2.\\) Canceling the factors of \\(x-1\\) from the numerator and denominator is OK for all values of \\(x\\) except \\(x=1\\). However, we’re only looking at what happens when \\(x\\) is close to 1, not equal to 1, so the cancellation makes sense.\n\n\n\nIf you look at \\(\\lim_{t\\to{0}}\\left(\\frac{1}{t} - \\frac{1}{t^2+t}\\right)\\quad\\text{or}\\quad\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to{-4}}\\frac{\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{x}}{4+x}\\) you will get the forms \\(\\infty-\\infty\\) and \\(\\tfrac00\\).\nThere are ways to simplify these fractions. For example, we can change the form of the function that is a sum or difference of fractions by finding a common denominator. For instance, \\(\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{x}= \\frac{x}{4x} + \\frac{4}{4x} = \\frac{x+4}{4x},\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{t} - \\frac{1}{t^2+t} = \\frac{t+1}{t^2+t}-\\frac{1}{t^2+t} = \\frac{t}{t^2+t} = \\frac{1}{t+1} \\left(\\text{since } t\\ne 0\\right)\\). These are examples of how to do more work when you get indeterminate forms \\(\\infty-\\infty\\) and \\(\\tfrac00\\) involving fractions.\nThe following video shows the details of evaluating these limits.\n\n\n\nRecall that the definition of the absolute value of a number \\(a\\) is\n\\(|a|=\\begin{cases}a &\\text { if } a\\ge 0;\\\\-a&amp;\\text { if }\na&lt; 0.\\\\ \\end{cases}\\) This makes sense: let \\(a=-3\\). Then\n\\(a&lt;0\\) so we take the second case, and say that\n\\(|-3|=-(-3)=3\\).\nThe definition above works for functions as well as numbers:\n\\(|f(x)|=\\begin{cases} f(x), &\\text{ if } f(x)\\ge0;\\\\ -f(x),\n&amp;\\text{ if } f(x)&lt;0.\\\\ \\end{cases}\\) Working with absolute\nvalues almost always involves breaking into two cases.\nFor example, let \\(f(x)=x-5\\). Consider \\(|f(x)|\\). We know\n\\(|f(2)|=|2-5|=|-3|=3\\). This works using the definition above\nas well: since when \\(x=2\\), \\(x-5&lt;0\\), we use the second\ncase. Then \\(|f(2)|=-f(2)=-(-3)=3\\). The beauty of the\ndefinition is that it works no matter what we plug in for \\(x\\).\nIn fact, the absolute value of a function can be viewed as\nshort-hand notation for a piecewise-defined function.\nUsing this information, and by studying pieces of the function\nseparately, we can determine how to take the limit of a function containing absolute values.\n\n\n\nWhen dealing with sums or differences of square roots, we sometimes wish to rationalize the expression. Notice: we do not insist that you rationalize the denominator of all fractions; rather we rationalize anything that will help evaluate a limit.\nThe key fact is the way we factor a difference of squares: \\(a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)\\). When we use this with square roots, we get that \\(A-B=(\\sqrt{A} + \\sqrt{B})(\\sqrt{A} - \\sqrt{B})\\), no matter what \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are (as long as they are non-negative). \\(\\sqrt A-\\sqrt B\\) is referred to as the conjugate of \\(\\sqrt A + \\sqrt B\\). For example, instead of working with \\(\\sqrt{x+1}-\\sqrt{x}\\), it is sometimes easier to multiply by the conjugate of the numerator (on top and bottom!), getting\n\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{x+1}-\\sqrt{x}}{1}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{x+1}+\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{x+1}+\\sqrt{x}}=\\frac{(x+1)-x}{\\sqrt{x+1}+\\sqrt{x}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x+1}+\\sqrt{x}}.\\)\nMultiplying by the conjugate can be helpful with square roots in either the numerator or in the denominator when you have an indeterminate limit. The following video shows how to use this technique to evaluate limits. This is yet another way to do more work when evaluating indeterminate limits.\n\n\n\nLimits with piece-wise defined functions are very similar to limits with absolute values, as we explained earlier. We have to work separately in each region, and then patch our results together.\n\n\n\nThe sandwich (aka squeeze) theorem is very useful for computing limits like \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}\\) that would be difficult to evaluate otherwise. It says that if \\(g(x)\\) is sandwiched between \\(f(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\), and \\(f(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\) have the same limit \\(L\\) as \\(x \\to a\\), then \\(g(x)\\) also approaches \\(L\\) as \\(x\\to a\\):\n\n\nSuppose that \\(f(x) \\le g(x) \\le h(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) that are close to (but not equal to) \\(a\\), and that \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to a} h(x) = L\\). Then \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to a} g(x) = L\\).\nWhen \\(x\\) is close to \\(a\\), \\(f(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\) are close to \\(L\\). So \\(g(x)\\) is somewhere between (a number close to \\(L\\)) and (another number close to \\(L\\)). This means that \\(g(x)\\) must be close to \\(L\\).\n\n\n\nEvaluate \\(\\displaystyle{\\lim_{x \\to 0} x^2 \\sin\\left(1/x\\right)}\\).\n\n\nWhy is it true that \\(-1\\le \\sin\\theta\\le 1\\) no matter what \\(\\theta\\) is?\n\n\n\nSince \\(-1 \\le \\sin(1/x)\\le 1\\), we can multiply all three sides by the (\\(\\ge 0\\)) value \\(x^2\\), getting \\(-x^2 \\le x^2 \\sin(1/x) \\le x^2\\). So \\(g(x)=x^2 \\sin(1/x)\\) is squeezed (or sandwiched) between \\(f(x)=-x^2\\) and \\(h(x)=x^2\\). Since both \\(-x^2\\) and \\(x^2\\) approach 0 as \\(x \\to 0\\), we must also have \\(\\lim_{x \\to 0} x^2 \\sin(1/x) = 0\\)."

That is, the rate at which \\(e^x\\) grows is exactly \\(e^x\\). We will see this rate when we differentiate \\(e^x\\) this semester."

Point out the risk: someone can be self-constituted but selfish, so the values must be kind and fair."

The quadratic formula tells us: “\\(x\\) is exactly 2 or exactly 3”.\nIn calculus, we have problems where we can’t get an exact answer directly. Instead, we find an approximate answer, then a better answer, then an even better answer. The exact answer is the limit of these approximations.\nA statement of a limit is “the limit as \\(x\\) approaches (some \\(x\\) value) of the function \\(f(x)\\) is exactly equal to (some \\(y\\) value), which we write as \\(\\lim_{x \\to \\text{(some x value)}} f(x) = \\text{(some y value)}.\\)\nFor example, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 5}(x^2-2)=23.\\)\nThis is the most important idea in all of calculus.

We can explore these cases separately. The statement \\(\\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) = L\\) means that whenever \\(x\\) is slightly greater than \\(a\\), \\(f(x)\\) is close to \\(L\\). In this case, we say: “the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) from the right is \\(L\\)”.\n\\(\\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) = L\\) means that whenever \\(x\\) is slightly less than \\(a\\), \\(f(x)\\) is close to \\(L\\). In this case, we say: “the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) from the left is \\(L\\)”.\n\n\n\nFor \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)\\) to exist and equal \\(L\\), we need \\(f(x)\\) to be approximately \\(L\\) on both sides of \\(x=a\\).\n\\(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow a}f(x)=L \\qquad \\Longleftrightarrow\\qquad \\lim_{x \\rightarrow a^-}f(x)=L \\text{ and } \\lim_{x \\rightarrow a^+}f(x)=L.\\)\nIf the two one-sided limits are different, or if one (or both) of them fail to exist, then the overall limit doesn’t exist.\nNote that the value of \\(f(a)\\) doesn’t enter into this, and it doesn’t matter whether \\(f(a)\\) is defined or not defined. Recall that when evaluating a limit of \\(f\\) as \\(x\\to a\\) we only care about what happens when \\(x\\) is near \\(a\\) (when \\(x\\) is slightly less than \\(a\\), or slightly greater than \\(a\\)), not what happens when \\(x\\) is equal to \\(a\\).\n\n\nThe statement \\(\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = \\infty\\) tells us that whenever \\(x\\) is close to (but not equal to) \\(a\\), \\(f(x)\\) is a large positive number. A limit with a value of \\(\\infty\\) means that as \\(x\\) gets closer and closer to \\(a\\), \\(f(x)\\) gets bigger and bigger; it increases without bound. Likewise, the statement \\(\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = -\\infty\\) tells us that whenever \\(x\\) is close to \\(a\\), \\(f(x)\\) is a large negative number, and as \\(x\\) gets closer and closer to \\(a\\), the value of \\(f(x)\\) decreases without bound.\nWarning: when we say a limit \\(=\\infty\\), technically the limit doesn’t exist. \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\) makes sense (technically) only if \\(L\\) is a number. \\(\\infty\\) is not a number! (The word “infinity” literally means without end.) If the limit is \\(+ \\infty\\), then the function increases without end. If the limit is \\(-\\infty\\), it decreases without end. We say a limit is equal to \\(\\pm\\infty\\) just to indicate this increase or decrease, which is more information than we would get if we simply said the limit doesn’t exist.\n\n\n\nDefinition: The line \\(x=a\\) is a vertical asymptote of a function \\(f\\) if the limit of \\(f\\) as \\(x\\to a\\) from the left and/or right is \\(\\pm\\infty\\). This means at least one of the following is true: * \\(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow a^+}f(x) = \\infty\\) * \\(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow a^-}f(x) = \\infty\\) * \\(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow a^+}f(x) = -\\infty\\) * \\(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow a^-}f(x) = -\\infty\\)\nHere are some examples of graphs with one or more vertical asymptotes. DO: Find all vertical asymptotes in the following graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if something happens as \\(x \\to a^+\\) and the same thing happens as \\(x \\to a^-\\), then the same also happens as \\(x \\to a\\). Conversely, if something happens as \\(x \\to a\\), then it also happens as \\(x \\to a^+\\) and as \\(x \\to a^-\\).\nHere is what the limit can be (if it exists): * \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = L\\) means that \\(f(x)\\) is close to the number \\(L\\) when \\(x\\) is near \\(a\\). This is the most common type of limit. * \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = \\infty\\) means that \\(f(x)\\) grows without bound as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\), eventually becoming bigger than any number you can name. Remember that \\(\\infty\\) is not a number! Rather, \\(\\infty\\) is a process of growth that never ends. * \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = -\\infty\\) means that as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\), \\(f(x)\\) goes extremely negative and never comes back, eventually becoming less than any number (say, minus a trillion) that you care to name.\nWith these ingredients we can make sense of any limit statement.\nExamples: * \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to 4^-} \\tfrac{1}{4-x} = \\infty\\) means that whenever \\(x\\) is slightly less than \\(4\\), \\(\\frac{1}{4-x}\\) is gigantic and positive. The graph \\(y=\\frac{1}{4-x}\\) will shoot upwards on the left side of the vertical asymptote \\(x=4\\). DO: Do the work to show \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to 4^+} \\tfrac{1}{4-x} = -\\infty\\). What does the graph of \\(y=\\tfrac{1}{4-x}\\) look like at \\(x=4\\)? What is \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to 4} \\tfrac{1}{4-x}\\)? * \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to 0} 13 (x+1) = 13\\) means that \\(f(x)=13(x+1)\\) is close to 13 whenever \\(x\\) is close to 0. So \\(f(0.01)\\) will be close to 13, and \\(f(0.000001)\\) will be really close to 13. * DO: Show that \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\tfrac1x\\) does not exist."

The exact answer is the limit of these approximations.\nA statement of a limit is “the limit as \\(x\\) approaches (some \\(x\\) value) of the function \\(f(x)\\) is exactly equal to (some \\(y\\) value), which we write as \\(\\lim_{x \\to \\text{(some x value)}} f(x) = \\text{(some y value)}.\\)\nFor example, \\(\\lim_{x\\to 5}(x^2-2)=23.\\)\nThis is the most important idea in all of calculus. You will need to learn it well as you work through understanding limits.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose \\(f(x)\\) is defined for all \\(x\\) near \\(a\\) (possibly excluding \\(a\\)). \\(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow a} f(x) = L\\) (read: “the limit of \\(f(x)\\), as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\), equals \\(L\\)”) means that we can get \\(f(x)\\) as close to \\(L\\) as we want by making \\(x\\) sufficiently close to \\(a\\).\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(x\\) is close to (but not equal) to \\(a\\), then \\(x\\) is either slightly greater or slightly less than \\(a\\). We can explore these cases separately. The statement \\(\\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) = L\\) means that whenever \\(x\\) is slightly greater than \\(a\\), \\(f(x)\\) is close to \\(L\\). In this case, we say: “the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) from the right is \\(L\\)”.\n\\(\\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) = L\\) means that whenever \\(x\\) is slightly less than \\(a\\), \\(f(x)\\) is close to \\(L\\). In this case, we say: “the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) from the left is \\(L\\)”.\n\n\n\nFor \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)\\) to exist and equal \\(L\\), we need \\(f(x)\\) to be approximately \\(L\\) on both sides of \\(x=a\\).\n\\(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow a}f(x)=L \\qquad \\Longleftrightarrow\\qquad \\lim_{x \\rightarrow a^-}f(x)=L \\text{ and } \\lim_{x \\rightarrow a^+}f(x)=L.\\)\nIf the two one-sided limits are different, or if one (or both) of them fail to exist, then the overall limit doesn’t exist.\nNote that the value of \\(f(a)\\) doesn’t enter into this, and it doesn’t matter whether \\(f(a)\\) is defined or not defined. Recall that when evaluating a limit of \\(f\\) as \\(x\\to a\\) we only care about what happens when \\(x\\) is near \\(a\\) (when \\(x\\) is slightly less than \\(a\\), or slightly greater than \\(a\\)), not what happens when \\(x\\) is equal to \\(a\\).\n\n\nThe statement \\(\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = \\infty\\) tells us that whenever \\(x\\) is close to (but not equal to) \\(a\\), \\(f(x)\\) is a large positive number. A limit with a value of \\(\\infty\\) means that as \\(x\\) gets closer and closer to \\(a\\), \\(f(x)\\) gets bigger and bigger; it increases without bound. Likewise, the statement \\(\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = -\\infty\\) tells us that whenever \\(x\\) is close to \\(a\\), \\(f(x)\\) is a large negative number, and as \\(x\\) gets closer and closer to \\(a\\), the value of \\(f(x)\\) decreases without bound.\nWarning: when we say a limit \\(=\\infty\\), technically the limit doesn’t exist. \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)=L\\) makes sense (technically) only if \\(L\\) is a number. \\(\\infty\\) is not a number! (The word “infinity” literally means without end.) If the limit is \\(+ \\infty\\), then the function increases without end. If the limit is \\(-\\infty\\), it decreases without end. We say a limit is equal to \\(\\pm\\infty\\) just to indicate this increase or decrease, which is more information than we would get if we simply said the limit doesn’t exist.\n\n\n\nDefinition: The line \\(x=a\\) is a vertical asymptote of a function \\(f\\) if the limit of \\(f\\) as \\(x\\to a\\) from the left and/or right is \\(\\pm\\infty\\). This means at least one of the following is true: * \\(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow a^+}f(x) = \\infty\\) * \\(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow a^-}f(x) = \\infty\\) * \\(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow a^+}f(x) = -\\infty\\) * \\(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow a^-}f(x) = -\\infty\\)\nHere are some examples of graphs with one or more vertical asymptotes. DO: Find all vertical asymptotes in the following graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if something happens as \\(x \\to a^+\\) and the same thing happens as \\(x \\to a^-\\), then the same also happens as \\(x \\to a\\). Conversely, if something happens as \\(x \\to a\\), then it also happens as \\(x \\to a^+\\) and as \\(x \\to a^-\\).\nHere is what the limit can be (if it exists): * \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = L\\) means that \\(f(x)\\) is close to the number \\(L\\) when \\(x\\) is near \\(a\\). This is the most common type of limit. * \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = \\infty\\) means that \\(f(x)\\) grows without bound as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\), eventually becoming bigger than any number you can name. Remember that \\(\\infty\\) is not a number! Rather, \\(\\infty\\) is a process of growth that never ends. * \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = -\\infty\\) means that as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\), \\(f(x)\\) goes extremely negative and never comes back, eventually becoming less than any number (say, minus a trillion) that you care to name.\nWith these ingredients we can make sense of any limit statement.\nExamples: * \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to 4^-} \\tfrac{1}{4-x} = \\infty\\) means that whenever \\(x\\) is slightly less than \\(4\\), \\(\\frac{1}{4-x}\\) is gigantic and positive. The graph \\(y=\\frac{1}{4-x}\\) will shoot upwards on the left side of the vertical asymptote \\(x=4\\). DO: Do the work to show \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to 4^+} \\tfrac{1}{4-x} = -\\infty\\). What does the graph of \\(y=\\tfrac{1}{4-x}\\) look like at \\(x=4\\)? What is \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to 4} \\tfrac{1}{4-x}\\)? * \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to 0} 13 (x+1) = 13\\) means that \\(f(x)=13(x+1)\\) is close to 13 whenever \\(x\\) is close to 0. So \\(f(0.01)\\) will be close to 13, and \\(f(0.000001)\\) will be really close to 13. * DO: Show that \\(\\displaystyle\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\tfrac1x\\) does not exist."

So, the independent variable of \\(f\\) is now the dependent variable of \\(f^{-1}\\) and vice versa. Graphically, this means that the horizontal axis becomes vertical, and the vertical axis horizontal.\nThe function \\(f^{-1}\\) exists only if \\(f\\) is one-to-one. Graphically, \\(f^{-1}\\) is a function if its graph passes the vertical line test, which means that the graph of \\(f\\) must pass the horizontal line test. If \\(f\\) is not one-to-one, we must restrict the domain of \\(f\\) first.\n\nFor instance, if \\(f(x)=x+1\\), then the inverse function is \\(f^{-1}(x)=x-1\\), since subtracting 1 undoes the effect of adding 1. If \\(f(x)=2x\\), then \\(f^{-1}(x)=x/2\\), since dividing by 2 undoes the effect of multiplying by 2. We’ll explore how to find the formula for \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) in general on the next slide.\n\n\n\n\nRemember that \\(y=f(x)\\) means the exact same thing as \\(x=f^{-1}(y)\\). To find a formula for \\(f^{-1}\\), 1. Solve for \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\). 2. Now you have \\(x=\\) (a function of y) = \\(f^{-1}(y)\\). 3. If you wish to have \\(x\\) be the independent variable (and if the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have no applicable meaning), simply exchange \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to get \\(y=f^{-1}(x)\\).\nExample 1: Find a formula for the inverse to \\(f(x) = 2x+1\\).\nSolution: Set \\(y=2x+1\\). By definition, \\(y = f(x) \\Longleftrightarrow x = f^{-1}(y)\\). Therefore, we have:\n\\(2x+1 = y\\)\n\\(2x = y-1\\)\n\\(x = \\frac{y-1}{2}\\).\nSo, \\(x=f^{-1}(y) = \\dfrac{y-1}{2}\\). You would leave the inverse in this form if, for example, \\(y\\) represents the cost of \\(x\\) widgets. In this case, \\(y=f(x)\\) tells us the cost, \\(y\\), for any given number of widgets, \\(x\\). \\(x=f^{-1}(y)\\) gives the number of widgets, \\(x\\), for a given cost \\(y\\). If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have no meaning, we may wish to rewrite the inverse of \\(f\\) with the independent variable \\(x\\): \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\dfrac{x-1}{2}\\).\nWarning: in general, \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) is not the same as \\(f(x)^{-1}\\)! Inverses and reciprocals are different things.\nExample 2: Find a formula for an inverse to \\(f(x) = 2x^2 + 5\\).\nSolution: In this case, \\(f\\) does not pass the horizontal line test, so \\(f\\) does not have an inverse defined on the whole domain. Let’s restrict the domain to \\([0,\\infty)\\), for example, so that now \\(f\\) does pass the HLT. DO: Why does \\(f\\) now pass the HLT?\nThe range of \\(f\\) is \\([5,\\infty)\\). Why? To find a formula for \\(f^{-1}\\), we write:\n\\(y = f(x) \\Leftrightarrow x=f^{-1}(y)\\)\n\\(2x^2 + 5 = y\\)\n\\(x^2 = (y-5)/2\\)\n\\(x = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{y-5}{2}}=f^{-1}(y)\\).\nBut here, \\(x\\) is not a function. So we must determine which square root we want. Since the range of \\(f^{-1}\\) is the domain of \\(f\\), our answer must be in \\([0,\\infty)\\), so we want the positive root: \\(f^{-1}(y) = x=+ \\sqrt{(y-5)/2}\\). This makes sense whenever \\(y \\ge 5\\). The domain of \\(f^{-1}\\) is \\([5,\\infty)\\), which is the range of \\(f\\). At this point, if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have no applicable meaning, you could switch \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) if needed to get \\(y=f^{-1}(x)=\\sqrt{\\frac{x-5}{2}}\\).\n\n\n\n\\(\\log_a(x)\\) is \\((0,\\infty)\\). We cannot take the log of zero or the log of a negative number.\n\n\nThe laws of logs follow from the law of exponents. You should know these.

So \\(\\log_7(5)=\\frac{\\ln 5}{\\ln 7}=\\frac{\\log 5}{\\log 7}\\), either of which you can compute using your calculator. These ratios are equal – do not think that \\(\\ln 5=\\log 5\\)! The power you raise \\(e\\) to to get 5 is not the same as the power you raise \\(10\\) to to get 5.\n\n\n\nBelow are the graphs of the log functions when \\(a&gt;1\\) or \\(0 &lt; a&lt;1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n          \n\n\nFind \\(\\tan^{-1}(\\sqrt 3)\\).\n\n\n\nIn practice, \\(\\sin^{-1}\\) and \\(\\tan^{-1}\\) come up a lot, \\(\\sec^{-1}\\) comes up occasionally, while \\(\\cos^{-1}\\), \\(\\cot^{-1}\\) and \\(\\csc^{-1}\\) almost never come up.\nAnother name for \\(\\sin^{-1}(x)\\) is \\(\\arcsin(x)\\). Likewise, \\(\\arctan(x)\\) and \\(\\arccos(x)\\) mean \\(\\tan^{-1}(x)\\) and \\(\\cos^{-1}(x)\\).\nThe “exponent” \\(-1\\) has more than one meaning, which you must infer from the context.

The absolute key condition for the IVT to apply is continuity. If the function has a jump, a hole, or an asymptote, the theorem does not necessarily hold.

We use it to understand problems and test solutions before applying them in real life.\n\n\nDeterministic Model\n\nAll inputs are known and fixed.\nNo uncertainty involved.\nExample: Calculating the area of a room. You know the length and width for sure.\n\n\nStochastic (Probabilistic) Model\n\nSome inputs are uncertain or random.\nInvolves probabilities.\nExample: Forecasting next week’s sales. It might be affected by weather, holidays, or other random events.\n\n\n\nThink of a deterministic model like a recipe: if you follow the instructions exactly, you get the same cake every time. A stochastic model is more like predicting the weather; you have good information, but you can’t be 100% certain. In business, we often have to choose between a simple, cheap model and a complex, expensive one. Sometimes, simpler is better!"
