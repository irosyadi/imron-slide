# Nine Things I Learned in Ninety Years
## A concise, student-friendly summary of Edward Packard (©2025)
Imron Rosyadi

## 1 Be self‑constituted — build a moral character

- Create a steady inner rulebook for how you act.
- Choose kindness, honesty, fairness, and compassion as guideposts.
- Integrity means your actions fit your values.

::: {.callout-note}
Being "self‑constituted" means you steer your life, not impulses or fashions.
:::

::: {.notes}
Give a quick example: if a friend cheats on a test, your principle guides you to be honest even if it's hard.
:::

## 2 Keep awake and aware — don't sleepwalk through life

- Pay attention to what you do and why.
- Sleepwalking = repeating habits without thinking.
- Being present helps avoid big mistakes.

::: {.notes}
Relate to social media scrolling: it's easy to "sleepwalk" through hours. Mindful pauses help.
:::

---

## 3 Consider what others think and feel
- Practice empathy (feel with others) and "theory of mind" (guess how they think).
- Before you speak, ask: How will this sound to them?
- Small thoughtfulness avoids many regrets.

::: {.notes}
Use the college anecdote: a single impulsive joke can offend—pause first.
:::

---

## 4 Make happiness your default state of mind

- Happiness can be a habit: be kind, respect others, and love more than seek being loved.
- Simple acts and attitudes raise baseline happiness.

$$\text{Happiness} \approx \text{Compassion} + \text{Respect} + \text{Gratitude}$$

::: {.callout-tip}
Giving warmth to others often makes you happier than only wanting to be loved.
:::

---

## 5 Seek an eternal perspective — widen your view

- Try to see life beyond just your wants and immediate outcomes.
- This reduces extreme swings of joy and anger and builds calmness.
- You can still care and enjoy life while staying less attached to results.

::: {.notes}
Use the snow leopard story: the search was wonderful even without the sighting.
:::

---

## 6 Guard against self‑deception

- People (even smart ones) fool themselves.
- Watch for confirmation bias: favoring info that fits your beliefs.
- Test your ideas: seek evidence that could prove you wrong.

::: {.callout-warning}
Question your own assumptions before acting.
:::

---

## 7 How to confront mortality

- Thinking about death can reduce fear and help you live better.
- Widening interests beyond the self makes loss less scary.
- Embrace life now; plan, but accept limits.

::: {.callout-important}
Contemplating death isn't morbid — it's a tool to prioritize what matters.
:::

---

## 8 Recognize the outsized role of luck

- Where and to whom you were born matters a lot.
- Success often comes from opportunities and chance, not only hard work.
- Use luck as a reason for humility and to help others.

::: {.notes}
Encourage gratitude and generosity when you notice your advantages.
:::

---

## 9 Value what you have right now

- Notice and appreciate present things before they’re gone.
- Act when important things matter, but pause to value them first.
- Shakespeare: we often miss the worth of things until they are lost.

::: {.callout-tip}
Practice daily gratitude: name three things you appreciate each evening.
:::

::: {.notes}
Suggest students pick one lesson to try for a week and journal results.
:::

---

## Short exercise (takeaway)

- Pick one lesson to try this week.
- Write 3 short notes each day: what you did, how you felt, and one thing you appreciated.
- After 7 days, reflect: did anything change?

::: {.notes}
This practical step helps move ideas into habits. Recommend sharing results in class discussion.
:::

---

## Final thought
- These lessons are simple but take practice.
- They help you make better choices, be kinder, and live with more calm and gratitude.
- Small habits over time change your life.

::: {.notes}
Close by encouraging curiosity: read one of the philosophers or Packard's full book if interested.
