<h2>Career Development: Communicating With Recruiters</h2>
<p>Effectively navigating conversations with recruiters is key to landing your desired role.</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Who has had experience working with a recruiter? What was the process like?</p>
<p>Did you ever experience uncertainty about how often you should reach out to your recruiter or what you should/shouldn’t share?</p>
<p>Hopefully this discussion will clear up some of that uncertainty and provide you with some best practices for communicating with recruiters that you can apply when you work with a recruiter next. Whether you’ve never worked with a recruiter or have worked with many, this session is for you. Let’s get started!</p>

<ul>
<li>Your recruiter is your advocate and partner. Be kind, respectful, friendly, and honest in your communications. They’re there to help you, provide you with resources, and guide you through the interview and hiring processes.</li>
<li>While you may also be in touch with a hiring manager, your recruiter is typically your main point of contact during an interview process with a company. Make sure to keep them in the loop with any updates that affect your candidacy.</li>
<li>Your recruiter will also keep you updated, so keep an eye on your inbox! You should always respond to your recruiter within 48 hours.</li>
<li>Tip: It’s always good to express your thanks and show your appreciation. Your recruiters work hard to ensure your process is as informative, timely, and smooth as possible. Show your positivity and gratitude. It can go a long way!</li>

<h2>Tips for Communicating With Your Recruiter</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read all emails from top to bottom</li>
<li>Answer all questions and provide all requested information</li>
<li>Schedule time to speak with your recruiter as needed</li>
<li>Respond to emails in a timely manner, within 48 hours is best</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>It is important to follow these tips when communicating with recruiters: * Read all emails from top to bottom: Recruiter emails often have a lot of information in them, and they don’t want you to miss anything. Be sure to scroll down and look for FAQs in case they’ve included them. Save your emails with recruiters to refer back to them as needed. Also, be sure to read through all links or attached materials. * Answer all the questions and provide all requested information to save time; a lot of inefficiency is caused by emailing back and forth unnecessarily, and you don’t want to slow down your process if you can avoid it. * Some recruiters will have a link to their calendars in their emails so you can choose a good time that works best for you. Otherwise, they will ask you for your availability. Be aware of times zones and make explicit plans. Make sure the contact details you provide are accurate and that it is clear who will be contacting whom if you connect over phone or video. * Recruiters try to respond to candidates as soon as possible. It’s important you do the same! Things can move pretty quickly, and you want to ensure you are keeping your recruiter posted with the most updated information possible. At the same time, you want to be mindful of work/life balance; recruiters won’t be responding to emails late at night or during weekends and holidays.</p>

<h2>When to Contact Your Recruiter</h2>

<p><strong>Tip</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Always be truthful, open, and honest with your recruiter. If they have the full picture of your status and options, they can guide your process with their company more comprehensively.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Students often ask, “Should I update my recruiter about that?” Here are some guidelines for when you definitely want to communicate with your recruiter:</p>
<ul>
<li>University deadlines: Some universities have specific guidelines on when its students are permitted to accept internship or full-time job offers. These guidelines exist to serve you and make sure you have sufficient time to make the best decision for yourself. Check to see if your university has NACE guidelines, and mark your calendar accordingly.</li>
<li>Company deadlines: If you’re interviewing with another company and receive an offer, let your recruiter know. You’ll hear recruiters refer to this as a “competing offer.” Having a competing offer can sometimes speed up the offer process at the other places where you’re interviewing. It would be a shame if you had to accept an offer with other possibilities on the table, so it’s important to be transparent with your recruiter to let them know if you have other offers or may soon.</li>
<li>Major update on your resume (e.g., new skill, award, conference, publication, etc.). Update your resume and send it as a PDF.</li>
<li>When you haven’t heard from your recruiter in a while (2+ weeks), you can reach out to check in and see if any progress has been made on their end or if they need anything from you.</li>
</ul>
<p>TIP: Always be truthful, open, and honest with your recruiter. If they have the full picture of your status and options, they can guide your process with their company more comprehensively.</p>

<h2>Scheduling Your Interviews</h2>
<ul>
<li>Provide a range of times that work for you around class, when you will be relaxed and most focused</li>
<li>Ensure that for phone interviews, you are sure of who is contacting whom and what the medium is</li>
<li>Ensure you know the difference between an interview and informational chat</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>At most companies, recruiters will schedule your interviews, or they will introduce you to a recruiting coordinator. Oftentimes recruiting coordinators partner with recruiters and candidates to schedule your interviews.</li>
<li>Generally companies interview between 10am-4pm PST, Monday through Friday.
<ul>
<li>Everyone wants you to feel comfortable and at your best.</li>
<li>Provide times that work for you and your class schedule.</li>
<li>Make sure you know the format of any interview, as well as who will be contacting whom and when. If you’ll be using a format you’re not that familiar with, like coding on a Google Doc, then you should practice coding in a Google Doc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sometimes, depending on the company, a recruiter or someone else in the company may want to start with an informational chat before jumping into official interviews. These will usually consist of talking about the role, company, and your resume. Ensure you have your resume in front of you and can speak about the experiences you want to highlight most. Also, it is so important that you do some basic research on the company. It’s common in an informational session to be asked about your knowledge about the company, your willingness to relocate, and what interests you about working there. Be ready to answer very general questions meant to show you are serious about the job hunt.</li>

<h2>Asking for Help</h2>
<ul>
<li>Let your recruiter know if you require interview accommodations.</li>
<li>Not sure what kind you need? Say so.</li>
<li>Disclosing a disability is a personal decision.</li>
<li>Don’t be shy. Ask for help at any point during the process.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Companies should be committed to providing equal opportunities for everyone throughout their hiring process.</li>
<li>If you’re not sure what type of accommodations you might need, that’s ok. Many companies have a specialist or team that will work directly to identify what types of accommodations you might require. If a company is too small to have a designated person or team for this important task, they should have a contractor or consultant who can assist.</li>
<li>Disclosing a disability or need for an accommodation is a personal decision. Ultimately the decision of whether or not to disclose is up to you, but you want to do everything you can to perform well in your interview and get the job or internship. Recruiters want that for you, too.</li>

<h2>Once Interviews Are Scheduled</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rescheduling an interview</li>
<li>Interviewer running late</li>
<li>Follow up with a thank you</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Rescheduling an interview</strong> * If an interview absolutely needs to be rescheduled, let your recruiter and recruiting coordinator know on one email as soon as possible. It’s best practice to reply all to the email where your interview was originally scheduled. * Keep rescheduling to a minimum. If you’re sick or there’s an emergency, rescheduling is warranted. But once your interview date is set, make sure to prepare yourself for that day. * Rescheduling multiple times might make you more anxious, so it’s generally best to stick with your originally planned interview date.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer is late</strong> * You’re waiting to start your interview and your interviewer is late. What do you do? Wait about 5-10 minutes. Interviewers are often going from meeting to meeting, and conference rooms may not be booked near each other. After 5-10 minutes, email your recruiter and recruiting coordinator (once again, on the same email thread), and let them know you haven’t heard from your interviewer yet. They’ll sort out what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you</strong> * Most recruiters can’t share interviewers’ contact information with you directly, but feel free to send a note to your recruiter to pass along to your interviewer. * It’s always nice to thank your recruiting coordinator and recruiter for their help prepping you and getting you scheduled.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve read an email exchange between a recruiter and candidate, take a look at this candidate’s response to their recruiter. Can you point out what’s wrong with the candidate’s response or what’s missing in this scenario?</p>
<p><em>Response should include: </em> The initial email from the recruiter states that there will be two technical interviews - remember to read all emails from top to bottom! * Availability for interviews is given in EST, not PST like the recruiter requested. * Availability for interviews is outside of general workings hours (late in the evening and on a Saturday). * Screenshot of transcript is pasted in body of email. Recruiter requested a PDF of both transcript and resume * Availability should be specific: for example, list dates as Tuesday, May 29 * The initial email from the recruiter says that the project questionnaire will be sent out within 24-48 hours. This usually means business hours. If you still haven’t received it within 48 business hours, you should reach out to your recruiter then. * Don’t expect an immediate response especially when it’s outside of our general working hours. Notice that this person was replying to their recruiter very early hours in EST. Remember, Googlers try to get back to everyone within 24 hours. * This person is sending multiple emails back to back. While it’s not necessarily a bad thing, it isn’t preferred for most recruiters. Keep your emails clear and concise. * It’s always nice to sign off with a thank you and your name! Be friendly!</p>

<ul>
<li>If a recruiter contacts you out of the blue, you should respond at least once. Ask clarifying questions and do some homework to see if the role is at all a good match for you. You don’t want them to waste your time, but don’t waste theirs, either.</li>
<li>It may not be the perfect role, but if it is at all interesting to you, you should go forward. You’ll learn a lot through the application process.</li>
<li>If an opportunity truly is not for you, you should respond honestly and courteously. You don’t have to write a long email or provide too much detail, but you can definitely feel free to give some feedback and you should follow up promptly.</li>
<li>It is not good professional etiquette to not respond, nor to lie. For example, don’t say you have a job if you don’t.</li>
<li>Remember you are still looking for a role and that people move around a lot. This recruiter could end up in a role or company years from now that could be your dream job, so you don’t want to burn bridges. Be polite, and if it seems like a good opportunity, you can ask to connect on LinkedIn or to be kept in mind for future roles that may be a better fit.</li>

<h2>Career Development: Preparing for Interviews</h2>
<p>Interview preparation is essential for success in securing your ECE &amp; ML roles.</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Today we’ll go over a basic overview of interview preparation and the differences between behavioral and technical interviews, both of which you’re likely to face as you job search. Technical interviews can be a very stressful experience for students starting their technical careers and seasoned professionals alike. These interviews should be stressful and require significant preparation, as you can be asked questions from a range of topics. Behavioral interviews also require preparation, but with the helpful framework we give you today, hopefully they will become manageable. And as with most things, both get easier with practice. Let’s dig in.</p>

<ul>
<li>Research company’s history, mission, and the job description fully.</li>

<li>Be able to clearly articulate why you’re a good fit.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>After</strong> →
<ul>
<li>Thank your interviewer(s).</li>
<li>Send a same-day thank you email that’s tailored to the interview.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>First, it’s extremely important to come prepared to an interview having researched the company, its history, the role, and why you’re a good fit for the position. It’s possible that you don’t meet all the requirements they’re looking for the role; this is common! But you can stand out as an especially desirable candidate by being passionate about the organization and the work it’s doing.</p>
<p>Always dress up for an interview. Don’t take a guess about whether or not a workplace is casual. If the recruiter or interviewer tells you in advance of the interview that attire is casual, still wear business casual to the interview. If the workplace is NOT casual, definitely wear business attire - a business suit.</p>
<p>Additionally, while they are evaluating your skills and fit for the role, interviews are a time for you to evaluate if this is a place you want to work.</p>
<p>Much like in your work with recruiters, show gratitude to your interviewers. Thank them during the interview and then in a same-day thank you email that mentions something you specifically enjoyed about the interview and that excites you about the role or the company. Sometimes you may not have access to the interviewer’s contact information. In that case, you should forward personalized thank you emails to your recruiter or whomever set up your interviews and ask them to pass your notes along. It’s important to remember that some interviewers could be your future boss, but other interviewers can be employees at the company whose job involves interviewing from time to time. It’s because people make time for that in their work that you’re able to interview in a timely way, so it’s important to show appreciation for their time.</p>

<h2>Technical Interview Basics</h2>
<p>There are five types of technical interview questions you’re likely to encounter:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Estimation questions</li>
<li>Knowledge questions</li>
<li>Probability questions</li>
<li>Coding questions</li>
<li>Open-ended questions</li>
</ol>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Now let’s get into the basics of technical interviews. Technical interviews vary depending on the kind of technical work you’ll be asked to do in the job. For technical roles related to data science and machine learning, you’re likely going to see questions of these five types:</p>
<p>1.) Estimation: These kinds of questions used to be popular in high tech in the late 90’s and have still not completely died out. They are significantly less common than they used to be though. Examples include, “Why are manhole covers round?” “What numbers would you put on each face of 2 D6s to represent dates?” These questions don’t really give a valuable signal to the employer.</p>
<p>2.) Knowledge: Knowledge questions can include anything within the field that you’re applying to and have been studying. Throughout this program we’ve tried to cover the topics that are likely to come up in the interview. It’s worth reviewing the list of topics that have been covered in the course.</p>
<p>3.) Probability: The interviewer is also likely to assess your knowledge of probability. This might be rolled into one of the other questions (e.g., coding or open-ended) but could be a separate question as well.</p>
<p>4.) Coding: There are likely to be coding questions as well. If you have a CS degree, check out the Cracking the Coding interview book and use it to practice. If you don’t, you’re still likely to get a coding question but hopefully one that is tailored to your abilities. Whatever question you get, this is definitely a place to practice active listening. Make sure you understand the question, ask clarifying questions, verify sample inputs and outputs. Also, coding on a whiteboard is weird and you need to practice it. And once you’re done writing the code, you’re not done. Verify that it works as intended by doing careful testing.</p>
<p>5.) Open-ended: Open-ended questions are often last because they can shrink or expand to fit the time that is left. They sound like knowledge questions but don’t have a single quick answer, and it’s more about the discussion that ensues than getting the “right” answer.</p>

      }</style></aside>
</section>
<section id="technical-interview-example-questions" class="slide level2 scrollable">
<h2>Technical Interview Example Questions</h2>
<p>Below is an example of each kind of technical question you’re likely to see:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Estimation</strong>: How many ping pong balls does it take to fill a 747 airplane?</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge</strong>: What is selection bias? Why does it matter?</li>
<li><strong>Probability</strong>: There is a research on two medical cures: A, B. 200 people tried the cure A, it helped 110 people and did not help 90 people. 210 people tried the cure B, it helped 120 people and did not help 90 people. Compute success percentages for each drug.</li>
<li><strong>Coding</strong>: Reverse all the words in a string of words while preserving the word order and spacing.</li>
<li><strong>Open-ended</strong>: Is it better to have too many false negatives or too many false positives?</li>
</ol>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Here’s an example of each of these kinds of technical questions. Estimation questions, as stated previously, are not commonly used anymore.</p>
<p>Next is knowledge questions. Knowledge questions might include, “What is selection bias? Why does it matter” or “What is linear regression?”</p>
<p>Third is probability questions. This is just one example. Other questions may include something like Bertrand’s box paradox or Penney’s game.</p>
<p>Fourth is coding. You could be presented with a lot of different coding questions. Again, Cracking the Coding Interview is a great resource for technical interview prep.</p>
<p>Fifth is open-ended. These are often reserved for the end of an interview because they can shrink and expand to meet the time that’s left in the interview.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>First, interviews are not like school work. They’re not like the work you’re doing in this program. They’re not even like the work you’re going to be doing with these employers. Therefore, you really need to prepare for them.</p>
<p>Second, the interviewer is not a judge. Think of them as your advocate. Can’t guarantee that you won’t get an interviewer who’s trying to trick you, but in most cases they are trying to help you.</p>
<p>Remember that you’re not just being evaluated; you’re also evaluating the company. That doesn’t mean you can ask questions for 20 minutes in a 45 minute interview, but come prepared with a few questions and take note of aspects of the application and interview process that reflect a workplace culture you’d want to join or not want to join.</p>
<p>Listen to your interviewer. Questions can sound similar, so make sure you understand what you’re being asked to do. Ask questions to clarify the problem and verbalize your thought process. It’s better to say something wrong than to say nothing. Make sure you’re justifying (and vocalizing) your assumptions.</p>
<p>Last, there are usually multiple correct answers. Take the time to think. Pick carefully.</p>

<p>Now let’s transition into behavioral interviews. Remember that in behavioral interviews, employers are assessing your likelihood of future behavior based on past behavior. How have you responded in specific situations that will help employers to know how you’ll respond in future, similar situations?</p>
<p>Here are some sample behavioral interview questions they may use to help do that. Can you think of some others you’ve heard?</p>
<p>As you can see, there are a lot of different directions you could take your answers to these questions. The best way to prepare for behavioral interviews is to have a bank of stories lined up that align with the role’s expectations and required/preferred qualifications. You might be wondering how to create that bank of stories, which is what we’ll discuss in the next two slides.</p>

<h2>Behavioral Interview Basics: STAR Method</h2>

<img data-src="09_res/interviewprep01.png?raw=true" class="center r-stretch quarto-figure-center"><p class="caption">Behavioral Interview Basics: STAR Method</p><aside class="notes">
<p>The best way to approach creating a bank of behavioral interview stories is to follow the STAR method. Take a few moments to read this slide over before we get started. [Provide students 1-2 minutes of silence to read the slide.]</p>
<p>The STAR method is a tried and true technique for preparing for behavioral interviews and successfully answering behavioral interview questions. In the 1-2 minutes in which you’re responding to a behavioral interview question, you should format your answer using the STAR method: describe the situation, the task or tasks, the actions you took, and the result. Remember, most behavioral interview questions start with “Tell me about a time when…” or “Describe a time when…” so interviewers are explicitly looking for you to tell a true story about your past academic or professional experiences. Practicing your stories in this order and keeping this framework in your head will help you deliver more effective, organized answers in interviews.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example.</p>

<p>Let’s recap! Please don’t forget that interviews require a lot of preparation. They are not like school work. They’re not like the work you’re doing in this course. They’re not even like the work you’re going to be doing with an employer. Therefore, you really need to prepare for them.</p>
<p>Remember that you’re not just being evaluated; you’re also evaluating the company. Both before, during, and after the interview, you should pay attention to what’s a good fit for you at this company and for this role, and what may not be.</p>

<p>Effective communication is crucial for ECE professionals, especially when presenting technical work.</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Today we’re talking about everyone’s favorite topic: public speaking. That was my attempt at a joke. I’m sure some of you enjoy public speaking and maybe others avoid it like the plague.</p>
<p>Presenting with confidence is a critical skill, though. Your career will hopefully provide opportunities to give presentations to your team, at professional conferences, and/or in academic settings. Being an effective presenter gives you credibility and visibility across all of those environments. Furthermore, hard work can be overlooked or under-appreciated if presenters don’t convey their ideas and work products in clear, understandable, and compelling ways.</p>
<p><em>Share any anecdote or personal story about why presenting with confidence is such an important skill.</em></p>
<p>But being a strong presenter takes time to learn and practice. So I hope no matter where you are in your experience with presenting with confidence, you can take a few tips and some extra experience from today’s session.</p>

<li>Know your audience</li>
<li>Tell a story</li>
<li>Make your ideas flow in an organized fashion</li>
<li>Summarize main points</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>First let’s discuss content, which is everything you say, display, or show in your presentation.</p>
<p>No matter what information you’re sharing, it’s important you tailor it to your audience. If the information you’re presenting to a non-technical or mixed audience is too technical or not well-explained, your audience is likely to tune out. Increase the likelihood that your presentation will be engaging and well-received by tailoring your slide design, verbiage, and content to them.</p>
<p>Second, using examples is a great way to tell a story that keeps your audience engaged. People remember how stories illuminated a particular point better than they will if just the point is presented.</p>
<p>Third, try to maintain a logical progression of ideas, keeping in mind the main purpose of the presentation. When possible, provide an agenda. With long presentations, it’s a good idea to benchmark your progress or potentially create different sections so the audience knows where you are in the presentation.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s important to summarize the main points of your presentation at the end of any presentation and throughout different sections if the presentation is 30 or more minutes.</p>

<p>Next up is delivery, or, how you get the content across to your audience.</p>
<p>Pitch or ‘musicality’ has to do with the note with which we pitch a word or phrase. Steering away from a monotone and varying your pitch when appropriate grabs attention and emphasizes what you want to express. It also helps convey the urgency or novelty of what you’re saying.</p>
<p>Pace is the speed at which you talk. Pace can also be helpful to drive emphasis. For instance, when you want to highlight an important point, slow down and speak distinctly.</p>
<p>Next is power. Regardless of whether you speak quietly or loudly in day-to-day conversation, being able to project your voice while presenting is a clear sign of confidence. It is impossible to ‘whisper’ and still be heard.</p>
<p>Pausing allows you time to think, and it can be effectively used to create anticipation. Sometimes silence can get people’s attention more than speaking. It also allows sufficient time for an audience to fully absorb your message.</p>
<p>Which of these is something you think your presentation skills should improve on? Or what do you feel like you do well?</p>

<p>Now that we’ve covered what makes up a strong presentation, let’s go over some suggestions for how to achieve it. These are some general rules of thumb when making any presentation.</p>
<p>It’s important that your slides, tone, and overall presentation are consistent.</p>
<p>A presentation should be a simple representation of pieces of information. It only acts as a visual aid to the broader story, project, or conversation. Therefore, the key points in this deck would be explained verbally in a presentation rather than all piled onto a slide.</p>
<p>For all slides, apply the 3-second rule. People should be able to glean the point you’re trying to convey on a slide within three seconds or less.</p>

<section id="tips" class="slide level2">
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>Avoid these common habits * Not practicing * Not recording practice * Using filler words * Fidgeting * Avoiding eye contact or engagement * Rushing</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>These are common presentation quirks that usually stem from nervousness or lack of preparedness. It’s important to be aware and try to avoid them, as they can detract from the impact of your presentation.</p>
<p>First, know your content, and do not read directly from the slides. Even if you feel you know your content well, practicing is essential. You may pick up on a slide or order that needs revising.</p>
<p>Record yourself when you practice so you can see what the audience will see. Look for ways to improve. Were there any awkward transitions? Did something not make sense?</p>
<p>Avoid using comfort/filler words like “um, like, y’know.” This is often subconscious. We don’t always realize when or how often we use fillers, which is another great reason to record yourself practicing.</p>
<p>Fidgeting, like touching your hair, fiddling with your clothes, etc., is very distracting for the audience. Some people roll up a piece of paper or pull on their work badge. Work on it if you know you have something like that.</p>
<p>A key part of presenting with confidence is engaging with your audience. You don’t want to exclude them from the presentation by avoiding eye contact or looking at the floor. Rotate who you make eye contact with to help keep people engaged. Ask them questions, and engage them in what you’re doing.</p>
<p>Don’t speed through your presentation. Your audience wants to hear what you have to say, and it is more inclusive of different kinds of learners and people with varying levels of English language acquisition to speak clearly and not too fast.</p>
<p>Which of these do you fall victim to?</p>

<img data-src="09_res/presentconfidence04.png?raw=true" class="center r-stretch quarto-figure-center"><p class="caption">Activity: List of Values</p><aside class="notes">
<p>Take a moment to read over the list of values. When you’re done, write down the eight values that resonate with you most or add other one-word values that resonate with you. (This is list not exhaustive.)</p>
<p>Looking at this list of eight, star the four values that are most important to you.</p>
<p>Now, this part might be the most difficult, but the final task here is to circle two of those four values that are your core values. You may find that some of the other values that resonate with you fall under those two. Think of these values as the ones you hold yourself to in your everyday behavior and future planning, the values you aspire to embody - maybe so much so that you do so unconsciously.</p>
<p><em>Allow students one minute to find those two values.</em></p>
<p>Why two values, you may ask? Researcher, public speaker, social worker, and famous author Brene Brown writes extensively about the importance of determining your two core values. If we have too many, they lose meaning and we aren’t able to hold ourselves to them. The two values that feel inextricably intertwined with who you are as a person are those two values.</p>
<p><em>Facilitator should feel free to share their own two values here.</em></p>
<p>Does anyone want to share what 1 or 2 of their values are?</p>

<h2>Practice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pick a partner</li>
<li>Take 3-4 minutes to prepare a 1½ -2 minute presentation on this prompt:
<ul>
<li>What are the two values that are most important to you?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Take 6 minutes to present to one another and give feedback
<ul>
<li>3 minutes each</li>
<li>1½ - 2 minutes to present</li>
<li>1 minute of feedback</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Let’s not film it for now, so your partner can be fully present</li>
<li>Share one strength and one area of improvement for your partner after they present
<ul>
<li>Remember, helpful feedback is clear, specific, kind, future-focused, and starts with “I”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, we’re going to share these values in a brief presentation to a partner. (We’ll also revisit these values in our next career development session, so don’t forget what you chose!)</p>
