## Systems of Linear Equations & Matrices for EEs üîå

A Foundational Tool for Electrical Engineering

---

### 1.1 Introduction to Systems of Linear Equations

A linear equation in variables $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ is one that can be expressed as:  
$a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \dots + a_nx_n = b$

A **system of linear equations** is a collection of one or more such equations.

**Example:** Find the currents $I_1$ and $I_2$ in a simple circuit.  
$5I_1 + 2I_2 = 12$  
$2I_1 + 3I_2 = 10$

**A system can have:**
1. **No solution** (Inconsistent)
2. **Exactly one solution** (Consistent)
3. **Infinitely many solutions** (Consistent)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Linear System] --> B{Consistent?};
    B -- No --> C[No Solution];
    B -- Yes --> D{Unique?};
    D -- Yes --> E[One Solution];
    D -- No --> F[Infinitely Many Solutions];
```

### 1.2 Gaussian Elimination

The standard algorithm for solving systems of linear equations.

**Goal:** Transform the system's **augmented matrix** into **row-echelon form** using **elementary row operations**.

**Augmented Matrix for our example:**  

$$
 \left[ \begin{array}{cc|c} 5 & 2 & 12 \\\ 2 & 3 & 10 \end{array} \right] 
$$

-v-

**The 3 Elementary Row Operations:**
1. Multiply a row by a non-zero constant. (Scaling)
2. Interchange two rows. (Swapping)
3. Add a multiple of one row to another row. (Replacement)

This process simplifies the system, making it easy to solve via **back-substitution**.

### 1.3 Matrices and Matrix Operations

A **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers. An $m \times n$ matrix has $m$ rows and $n$ columns.

* **Addition ($A+B$)**: Add corresponding entries. Matrices must be the same size.
* **Scalar Multiplication ($cA$)**: Multiply every entry by scalar $c$.
* **Matrix Multiplication ($AB$)**: More complex! The $(i, j)$-th entry of $AB$ is the dot product of the $i$-th row of A and the $j$-th column of B.
    * **Dimension Rule**: To multiply $A_{m \times n}$ by $B_{p \times q}$, we must have $n=p$. The result is an $m \times q$ matrix.

**Crucial Property**: In general, $AB \neq BA$. Order matters! ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1.4 Inverses; Algebraic Properties of Matrices

The **Identity Matrix**, $I$, is a square matrix with 1s on the main diagonal and 0s elsewhere. It's the matrix equivalent of the number 1.  
$AI = IA = A$

The **Inverse** of a square matrix $A$ is a matrix $A^{-1}$ such that:  
$A A^{-1} = A^{-1} A = I$

* If $A^{-1}$ exists, $A$ is called **invertible** or **non-singular**.
* If $A^{-1}$ does not exist, $A$ is called **singular**.

-v-

**Key Properties:**
* $(A^{-1})^{-1} = A$
* $(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1}$ (Note the order reversal!)
* $(A^T)^{-1} = (A^{-1})^T$

---

### 1.5 Finding an Inverse ($A^{-1}$)

We can find the inverse of a matrix $A$ by augmenting it with the identity matrix $I$ and performing Gaussian elimination.

**The Method:**
1. Create the augmented matrix $[ A | I ]$.
2. Use elementary row operations to reduce the left side ($A$) to the identity matrix ($I$).
3. The right side will be transformed into the inverse, $A^{-1}$.  
    $[ A | I ] \xrightarrow{\text{row operations}} [ I | A^{-1} ]$

If you cannot reduce $A$ to $I$, then the matrix is singular and has no inverse.

### 1.6 Linear Systems and Invertible Matrices

The matrix inverse gives us a powerful way to solve a system of $n$ equations in $n$ variables.

Consider the system in matrix form: $Ax = b$  
Where $A$ is the coefficient matrix, $x$ is the vector of variables, and $b$ is the vector of constants.

If $A$ is invertible, we can solve for $x$:
1. Start with $Ax = b$
2. Left-multiply both sides by $A^{-1}$: $A^{-1}(Ax) = A^{-1}b$
3. Associate: $(A^{-1}A)x = A^{-1}b$
4. Simplify: $Ix = A^{-1}b$
5. Result: $x = A^{-1}b$

This means if a matrix is invertible, the system $Ax=b$ has a **unique solution** for any vector $b$. üëç

### 1.7 Special Matrices: Diagonal, Triangular, Symmetric

These matrices appear frequently in engineering applications and have useful properties.

* **Diagonal Matrix**: Non-zero entries only on the main diagonal.  

$$
D = \begin{bmatrix} d_1 & 0 & 0 \\\ 0 & d_2 & 0 \\\ 0 & 0 & d_3 \end{bmatrix}
$$

* **Triangular Matrix**: All entries above (lower triangular) or below (upper triangular) the main diagonal are zero.
* **Symmetric Matrix**: The matrix is equal to its transpose ($A = A^T$). It is symmetric across the main diagonal.  

$$
S = \begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\ b & d & e \\\ c & e & f \end{bmatrix}
$$

Symmetric matrices are fundamental in describing quadratic forms, which appear in stability analysis and optimization problems.

### 1.8 Matrix Transformations

We can think of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ as a function, or **transformation**, that maps vectors from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$.

The transformation $T$ is defined by $T(\vec{x}) = A\vec{x}$.

**Geometric Interpretation in $\mathbb{R}^2$:**
* **Rotation:**

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
$$

* **Scaling:**

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} s_x & 0 \\\ 0 & s_y \end{bmatrix}
$$

* **Shear:**

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & k \\\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

This viewpoint is essential for graphics, control systems, and signal processing.

### 1.9 Applications in Electrical Engineering

Why did we learn all this? Because matrices are the language of modern engineering analysis! üöÄ

We will focus on the most direct EE application: **Electrical Circuit Analysis**.

Other important applications include:
* Network Analysis (TrafÔ¨Åc Flow, Data Networks)
* Polynomial Interpolation (Curve Fitting for sensor data)
* Leontief Input-Output Models (Economics & Systems Engineering)

### Application: Electrical Circuit Analysis

We use **Kirchhoff's Laws** to model circuits. These laws produce a system of linear equations.

1. **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL):** At any node (junction), the sum of currents flowing in equals the sum of currents flowing out. $\sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out}$.
2. **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):** The sum of the voltage drops around any closed loop is zero. $\sum V_{loop} = 0$.

We use **Ohm's Law** ($V=IR$) to relate voltage, current, and resistance.

### Circuit Example Setup

Let's find the currents $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$ in the circuit below.

```language-plantuml
@startuml
skinparam linetype ortho
electrical
(S) -- R(R1=2) -- (N1)
(N1) -- R(R2=4) -- (N2)
(N1) -- R(R3=1) -- (S)
(N2) -- V(V1=5) -- (S)
(N2) -- R(R4=3) -- (S)
node "I_1" as I1 at (S,N1)
node "I_2" as I2 at (N1, N2)
node "I_3" as I3 at (N2, S)
@enduml
```

**Equations from Kirchhoff's Laws:**
* **KCL at Node N1:** $I_1 = I_2 + I_3$ &rarr; $I_1 - I_2 - I_3 = 0$
* **KVL on Left Loop:** $2I_1 + 1I_3 = 10$
* **KVL on Right Loop:** $4I_2 - 1I_3 = -5$

---

### Circuit Example: Matrix Solution

Our system of equations is:  
$I_1 - I_2 - I_3 = 0$  
$2I_1 + 0I_2 + I_3 = 10$  
$0I_1 + 4I_2 - I_3 = -5$

In matrix form, $Ax=b$:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -1 & -1 \\\\
2 & 0 & 1 \\\\
0 & 4 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} I_1 \\\ I_2 \\\ I_3 \end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\ 10 \\\ -5 \end{bmatrix}
$$

Solving this system (using Gaussian elimination or finding $A^{-1}$) gives the currents in the circuit. This technique scales to analyze incredibly complex integrated circuits!

**This concludes our introduction. Mastering these fundamentals is key to success in advanced EE topics!** üéì
