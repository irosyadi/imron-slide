    "text": "Analog Transmission Standards: 4–20 mA\nWhy current instead of voltage?\n\n\n\nFIGURE 20: Current nearly independent of line resistance.\n\n\n\nCurrent loop is almost independent of wire resistance (0–1000 Ω).\nVoltage at receiver can vary, but as long as current is correct, the signal is accurate.\n\n\nHighlight that many industrial transmitters are “two-wire” 4–20 mA devices: same two wires supply power and carry the signal.\nStudents should recognize 4–20 mA as a “universal language” of analog instrumentation."
