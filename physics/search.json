Instantaneous velocity:\n\nFirst, find the general instantaneous velocity function v(t): \\[ v(t) = \\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ (3.0 \\text{ m/s})t - (3.0 \\text{ m/s}^2)t^2 \\right] \\] \\[ v(t) = (3.0 \\text{ m/s}) - (3.0 \\text{ m/s}^2) \\cdot 2 \\cdot t^{2-1} \\] \\[ v(t) = (3.0 \\text{ m/s}) - (6.0 \\text{ m/s}^2)t \\]\nNow, substitute the given times:\n\nAt \\(t = 0.25 \\text{ s}\\): \\(v(0.25 \\text{ s}) = 3.0 \\text{ m/s} - (6.0 \\text{ m/s}^2)(0.25 \\text{ s}) = 3.0 \\text{ m/s} - 1.5 \\text{ m/s} = 1.5 \\text{ m/s}\\)\nAt \\(t = 0.50 \\text{ s}\\): \\(v(0.50 \\text{ s}) = 3.0 \\text{ m/s} - (6.0 \\text{ m/s}^2)(0.50 \\text{ s}) = 3.0 \\text{ m/s} - 3.0 \\text{ m/s} = 0 \\text{ m/s}\\)\nAt \\(t = 1.0 \\text{ s}\\): \\(v(1.0 \\text{ s}) = 3.0 \\text{ m/s} - (6.0 \\text{ m/s}^2)(1.0 \\text{ s}) = 3.0 \\text{ m/s} - 6.0 \\text{ m/s} = -3.0 \\text{ m/s}\\)\n\n\n2. Speed of the particle:\n\nSpeed is the magnitude of velocity, \\(|v(t)|\\):\n\nAt \\(t = 0.25 \\text{ s}\\): Speed \\(= |1.5 \\text{ m/s}| = 1.5 \\text{ m/s}\\)\nAt \\(t = 0.50 \\text{ s}\\): Speed \\(= |0 \\text{ m/s}| = 0 \\text{ m/s}\\)\nAt \\(t = 1.0 \\text{ s}\\): Speed \\(= |-3.0 \\text{ m/s}| = 3.0 \\text{ m/s}\\)\n\n\n\nObserve the velocity at 0.50 s. It’s zero. This means the particle momentarily stops and reverses direction. At 1.0 s, the velocity is negative, indicating movement in the negative direction, but the speed is positive, just showing ‘how fast’."

    "text": "The Universal Nature of Gravity\n\nA remarkable fact: if air resistance and friction are negligible, all objects fall toward the center of Earth with the same constant acceleration, regardless of their mass.\nThis was famously demonstrated by Galileo Galilei, and later by astronaut David R. Scott on the Moon.\n\n\nFigure 3.26: Hammer and feather falling in air vs. vacuum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn the real world, air resistance causes lighter, less dense objects to fall slower. Our free-fall model ignores this for simplicity.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a cornerstone concept in physics. It’s counter-intuitive because our everyday experience is dominated by air resistance. But in a vacuum, a feather and a bowling ball fall at the same rate."

Since it’s a polar orbit, we can choose our coordinate system such that the North Pole corresponds to a point on the y-axis. The -45° latitude position can be described using polar coordinates relative to the x-axis.\nStep 2: The radius of the orbit is constant. For \\(t_1\\), the satellite is directly above the North Pole, meaning its position vector points straight up along the y-axis. For \\(t_2\\), we use trigonometry. A latitude of -45° corresponds to an angle of 45° South of the Equator. In our x-y plane (x=East, y=North), this position can be found using \\(R\\cos(\\theta)\\) for x and \\(R\\sin(\\theta)\\) for y, where \\(\\theta\\) is measured from the positive x-axis. A -45° latitude means the angle from the positive x-axis is -45°."
