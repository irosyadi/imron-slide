This gives us two equations and two unknowns (\\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\)), which we can solve simultaneously. Notice that \\(T_2\\) is greater than \\(T_1\\) because it’s at a steeper angle, meaning it contributes more vertically and less horizontally, so it needs to be larger to balance the horizontal component from \\(T_1\\) and still contribute significantly to the vertical balance."

The first tugboat exerts a force of \\(2.7×10^5\\) N in the x-direction, and the second tugboat exerts a force of \\(3.6×10^5\\) N in the y-direction. The mass of the barge is \\(5.0×10^6\\) kg and its acceleration is observed to be \\(7.5×10^{−2}\\) \\(m/s^2\\) in the direction shown. What is the drag force of the water on the barge resisting the motion? (Note: Drag force is a frictional force exerted by fluids, such as air or water. The drag force opposes the motion of the object. Since the barge is flat bottomed, we can assume that the drag force is in the direction opposite of motion of the barge.)\n\nFigure 6.4: Tugboats pushing a barge.\n\n\nSystem: Barge (mass \\(m = 5.0 \\times 10^6 \\text{ kg}\\)).\nForces: \\(\\vec{F}_1 = 2.7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ N}\\) (x-dir), \\(\\vec{F}_2 = 3.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ N}\\) (y-dir), \\(\\vec{F}_D\\) (drag).\nAcceleration: \\(\\vec{a} = 7.5 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ m/s}^2\\) at \\(53.1^\\circ\\) from x-axis.\nStrategy: Find \\(\\vec{F}_{app} = \\vec{F}_1 + \\vec{F}_2\\), then apply Newton’s 2nd Law.\n\nMagnitude of \\(\\vec{F}_{app} = \\sqrt{(2.7 \\times 10^5)^2 + (3.6 \\times 10^5)^2} = 4.5 \\times 10^5 \\text{ N}\\).\nDirection of \\(\\vec{F}_{app} = \\tan^{-1}(3.6/2.7) = 53.1^\\circ\\).\nSince drag opposes motion, it acts opposite to \\(\\vec{F}_{app}\\).\n\nSolve: \\(F_{net} = F_{app} - F_D = ma\\).\n\n\\(4.5 \\times 10^5 \\text{ N} - F_D = (5.0 \\times 10^6 \\text{ kg})(7.5 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ m/s}^2)\\).\n\\(F_D = 7.5 \\times 10^4 \\text{ N}\\).\n\n\n\n\nThis example introduces particle acceleration, where the net force is non-zero. The key here is to first combine the applied forces from the tugboats into a single resultant force vector. This resultant force gives the direction of the acceleration. Since the drag force opposes motion, it will act in the opposite direction to the resultant applied force. Then, we can apply Newton’s second law in the direction of motion to solve for the unknown drag force."

The weight vector needs to be resolved into components along these new axes. The normal force is then equal to the perpendicular component of the weight. This example shows how to find the coefficient of kinetic friction if the friction force is known, and then derives a useful shortcut formula for when an object slides at constant velocity."

This acceleration is always directed towards the center, hence “centripetal.” According to Newton’s second law, any acceleration must be caused by a net force.

Notice that the mass of the car cancels out when solving for the coefficient of friction, meaning the minimum coefficient required is independent of the car’s mass for a given speed and radius."

Then, we will formally define angular momentum for both individual particles and systems of particles, including rigid bodies. A significant part of this chapter will focus on the conservation of angular momentum, a powerful principle that helps explain many phenomena from ice skaters to celestial mechanics. Finally, we’ll explore the fascinating phenomenon of precession, particularly in gyroscopes, and learn how to calculate its rate.

It’s a combined motion, meaning the object is both rotating about an axis and translating, or moving linearly, through space. Think about a car tire: it spins, but the car also moves forward.

The key characteristic here is that the point on the wheel that is in contact with the ground is momentarily at rest relative to the ground. This might sound counterintuitive since the wheel is moving, but it means there’s no sliding at the contact point. This condition requires static friction, not kinetic friction. If you push the accelerator too hard in a car and the tires spin, that’s slipping, and kinetic friction is involved. However, when the car moves forward smoothly, static friction is at play, keeping the contact point from sliding.\nFigure 11.2 visually explains this: in part (a), a cyclist rolls forward without slipping, and the bottom of the tire deforms slightly, indicating it’s briefly at rest relative to the road. In part (b), the blur in the image shows that the top of the wheel moves faster, while the bottom is clearer, reinforcing that the contact point is instantaneously stationary.\nMathematically, this “no-slip” condition provides direct relationships between linear and angular variables. The velocity of the center of mass (\\(v_{CM}\\)) is simply the product of the wheel’s radius (\\(R\\)) and its angular velocity (\\(\\omega\\)). Similarly, the linear acceleration of the center of mass (\\(a_{CM}\\)) is the radius times the angular acceleration (\\(\\alpha\\)), and the linear distance traveled (\\(d_{CM}\\)) corresponds to the arc length (\\(R\\theta\\)). These relationships are fundamental for analyzing rolling motion without slipping."

It acts at the point of contact between the wheel and the surface, and its primary role is to prevent any sliding. It’s important to remember that for rolling without slipping, this is static friction, not kinetic friction. A key point about static friction in this context is that although it’s generally a non-conservative force, it does no work on the system when rolling without slipping. This is because the point of application of the static friction force—the contact point—is instantaneously at rest, meaning its displacement is zero, and thus \\(W = F \\cdot d = 0\\). This allows us to use conservation of mechanical energy for rolling without slipping, which we’ll discuss soon.\nOther forces include the gravitational force (\\(Mg\\)), which acts downward through the center of mass of the wheel, and the normal force (\\(N\\)), which acts upward, perpendicular to the surface, supporting the wheel.\nFigure 11.3(b) shows the relationships between linear velocity (\\(v_{CM}\\)) and acceleration (\\(a_{CM}\\)) of the center of mass, and the angular velocity (\\(\\omega\\)) and angular acceleration (\\(\\alpha\\)) of the wheel. For no slipping, \\(v_{CM} = R\\omega\\) and \\(a_{CM} = R\\alpha\\).\nFigure 11.3(c) gives an interesting perspective: from the frame of reference of the center of mass, the contact point P has a velocity of \\(-R\\omega \\hat{i}\\), moving backward relative to the center of mass. When you add the forward velocity of the center of mass itself (\\(v_{CM} \\hat{i} = R\\omega \\hat{i}\\)), the net velocity of point P relative to the ground is zero, confirming the no-slip condition."

This problem combines concepts of translational motion, rotational motion, and friction.\nPart (a): What is its acceleration? 1. Free-Body Diagram and Coordinate System: As shown in Figure 11.5, we set up a coordinate system with the x-axis down the incline and the y-axis perpendicular to it. The forces are: * Normal force (\\(N\\)) perpendicular to the plane. * Gravitational force (\\(mg\\)) acting vertically downward, resolved into components \\(mg\\sin\\theta\\) (down the incline) and \\(mg\\cos\\theta\\) (perpendicular to the incline). * Static friction (\\(f_s\\)) acting up the incline (opposing the tendency to slip).\n\nNewton’s Second Law (Linear):\n\nIn the y-direction: \\(\\sum F_y = N - mg\\cos\\theta = 0 \\Rightarrow N = mg\\cos\\theta\\).\nIn the x-direction: \\(\\sum F_x = mg\\sin\\theta - f_s = ma_{CM}\\).\n\nNewton’s Second Law (Rotational):\n\nThe only force creating a torque about the center of mass is the static friction force (\\(f_s\\)).\n\\(\\sum \\tau = f_s R = I_{CM}\\alpha\\).\nFor a solid cylinder, \\(I_{CM} = \\frac{1}{2}mr^2\\). So, \\(f_s R = \\frac{1}{2}mr^2\\alpha\\).\n\nRolling without Slipping Condition: \\(a_{CM} = R\\alpha \\Rightarrow \\alpha = \\frac{a_{CM}}{R}\\).\nSolve for \\(a_{CM}\\):\n\nSubstitute \\(\\alpha\\) into the torque equation: \\(f_s R = \\frac{1}{2}mr^2 \\frac{a_{CM}}{R} \\Rightarrow f_s = \\frac{1}{2}ma_{CM}\\).\nSubstitute \\(f_s\\) into the linear x-direction equation: \\(mg\\sin\\theta - \\frac{1}{2}ma_{CM} = ma_{CM}\\).\n\\(mg\\sin\\theta = \\frac{3}{2}ma_{CM}\\).\n\\(a_{CM} = \\frac{2}{3}g\\sin\\theta\\).\n\n\nPart (b): Condition for no slipping (\\(\\mu_s\\))? 1. Friction Condition: For no slipping, \\(f_s \\le \\mu_s N\\). 2. Substitute \\(f_s\\) and \\(N\\): * We found \\(f_s = \\frac{1}{2}ma_{CM} = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\frac{2}{3}g\\sin\\theta) = \\frac{1}{3}mg\\sin\\theta\\). * We know \\(N = mg\\cos\\theta\\). * So, \\(\\frac{1}{3}mg\\sin\\theta \\le \\mu_s mg\\cos\\theta\\). 3. Solve for \\(\\mu_s\\): * \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\sin\\theta \\le \\mu_s \\cos\\theta\\). * \\(\\mu_s \\ge \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\cos\\theta} \\Rightarrow \\mu_s \\ge \\frac{1}{3}\\tan\\theta\\).\nSignificance: The acceleration of the cylinder is \\(\\frac{2}{3}g\\sin\\theta\\), which is less than \\(g\\sin\\theta\\) (the acceleration if it were sliding without friction). This shows that some of the gravitational potential energy is converted into rotational kinetic energy rather than solely translational kinetic energy. The condition for static friction tells us that for steeper inclines (larger \\(\\theta\\)), a higher coefficient of static friction is required to prevent slipping."

This happens when the contact point between the wheel and the surface is moving relative to the surface.\nKey Characteristics of Rolling with Slipping:\n\nKinetic Friction: Because there’s relative motion at the contact point, the friction force involved is kinetic friction (\\(f_k\\)), not static friction. The magnitude of kinetic friction is typically given by \\(f_k = \\mu_k N\\), where \\(\\mu_k\\) is the coefficient of kinetic friction and \\(N\\) is the normal force.\nNo Simple Relationship between Linear and Angular Variables: Unlike rolling without slipping, the simple direct relationships \\(v_{CM} = R\\omega\\) and \\(a_{CM} = R\\alpha\\) no longer hold.

Therefore, mechanical energy is not conserved in rolling with slipping.\n\nFigure 11.6 illustrates this situation. In part (a), you see kinetic friction (\\(f_k\\)) opposing the motion or tendency to slip. In part (b), it explicitly states that \\(\\omega \\neq v_{CM}/R\\) and \\(\\alpha \\neq a_{CM}/R\\), highlighting the loss of the straightforward relationships we saw in the no-slip case.\nWhen solving problems with slipping, you typically treat the translational and rotational motions more independently, using Newton’s second law for linear motion (\\(F_{net} = ma_{CM}\\)) and for rotational motion (\\(\\tau_{net} = I\\alpha\\)), with the kinetic friction force being a fixed value (or dependent on the normal force)."

This means that the static friction force does no work (\\(W = F \\cdot d = 0\\)) because the displacement of its point of application is zero. Since no work is done by static friction, and assuming other non-conservative forces like air resistance are negligible, the total mechanical energy of the system remains constant.\nWhen is mechanical energy NOT conserved?\nMechanical energy is not conserved if the object is rolling with slipping. In this case, kinetic friction is present, and it performs negative work on the system, converting mechanical energy into thermal energy (heat). Therefore, if there’s slipping, you cannot directly apply the principle of conservation of mechanical energy; you would need to account for the work done by kinetic friction or use other methods like Newton’s laws.\nUnderstanding this distinction is crucial for correctly analyzing rolling motion problems."

This simplifies things greatly! The final velocity depends only on the Martian gravity and the height of the basin. This also tells us that for a hollow cylinder rolling without slipping, its kinetic energy is equally split between translational and rotational components. If the wheel had been a solid cylinder (with \\(I_{CM} = \\frac{1}{2}mr^2\\)), the distribution of kinetic energy would be different, and the final linear velocity would be higher."

Mathematically, this is expressed as \\(\\vec{l} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p}\\).\nMagnitude: The magnitude of this vector is \\(l = rp\\sin\\theta\\), where \\(r\\) is the magnitude of the position vector, \\(p\\) is the magnitude of the linear momentum, and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between the \\(\\vec{r}\\) and \\(\\vec{p}\\) vectors.

This is an important precursor to the conservation of angular momentum.\n\n\nFollowing these steps systematically will help you accurately determine angular momentum and its relation to torque for a single particle."

(b) Angular momentum component along z-axis.\n\nDerivation Insights:\n\nA rigid body can be modeled as many small mass segments (\\(\\Delta m_i\\)).\nEach segment has angular momentum \\(\\vec{l}_i\\).\nFor a cylindrically symmetric body rotating about its symmetry axis, the perpendicular components of \\(\\vec{l}_i\\) cancel out.\nOnly the components along the axis of rotation sum up to the total angular momentum.\n\n\n\nNow, let’s turn our attention to the angular momentum of a rigid body. A rigid body is an object that maintains its shape, meaning the relative positions of its constituent particles remain fixed.\nAngular Momentum Formula: For a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis (e.g., the z-axis) with an angular velocity \\(\\omega\\), the magnitude of its angular momentum (\\(L\\)) along that axis is given by:\n\\(L = I\\omega\\)\nWhere:\n\n\\(I\\) is the moment of inertia of the rigid body about the specific axis of rotation.\n\\(\\omega\\) is the angular velocity of the rigid body.\n\nThis equation is a direct analog to the linear momentum equation \\(p = mv\\). The moment of inertia (\\(I\\)) plays the role of mass (\\(m\\)), and angular velocity (\\(\\omega\\)) plays the role of linear velocity (\\(v\\)).\nDirection of Angular Momentum: The angular momentum vector (\\(\\vec{L}\\)) for a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis points along that axis of rotation. Its direction is determined by the right-hand rule: if you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of rotation, your thumb points in the direction of \\(\\vec{L}\\).\nDerivation Insight (as shown in Figure 11.12):\nTo understand why \\(L = I\\omega\\) works, imagine the rigid body as being made up of many tiny mass segments, \\(\\Delta m_i\\).\n\nEach segment \\(\\Delta m_i\\) at a distance \\(R_i\\) from the axis of rotation and moving with tangential velocity \\(v_i = R_i\\omega\\) has its own angular momentum \\(\\vec{l}_i = \\vec{r}_i \\times \\vec{p}_i\\).\nHowever, for a rigid body that is symmetric about the axis of rotation (like a cylinder or a sphere rotating about its central axis), the components of \\(\\vec{l}_i\\) that are perpendicular to the axis of rotation will cancel out due to symmetry. For every mass segment on one side, there’s an identical segment on the opposite side whose perpendicular angular momentum component points in the exact opposite direction.\nTherefore, only the components of \\(\\vec{l}_i\\) that lie along the axis of rotation contribute to the net angular momentum of the entire rigid body. Summing these axial components: \\(L = \\sum_i (l_i)_z = \\sum_i (R_i \\Delta m_i v_i) = \\sum_i (R_i \\Delta m_i (R_i \\omega)) = \\omega \\sum_i (\\Delta m_i R_i^2)\\).\nThe summation \\(\\sum_i (\\Delta m_i R_i^2)\\) is precisely the definition of the moment of inertia (\\(I\\)) of the rigid body about that axis. Hence, \\(L = I\\omega\\).\n\nThis formula is incredibly useful for calculating the angular momentum of common rotating objects."

Just as linear momentum is conserved when the net external force on a system is zero, angular momentum is conserved when the net external torque on a system is zero.\nKey Point: While the total angular momentum of the system remains constant, the individual angular momenta of components within the system can change, as long as their vector sum remains the same. Also, the moment of inertia (\\(I\\)) and angular velocity (\\(\\omega\\)) can change, but their product (\\(I\\omega\\)) must remain constant.\nThis principle is fundamental to understanding a wide range of phenomena, from the macroscopic world of ice skaters to the vast scales of the cosmos, like the formation of solar systems."

The Ice Skater: This is perhaps the most iconic demonstration of angular momentum conservation.\n\nWhen an ice skater spins with her arms and legs extended, her mass is distributed further from her axis of rotation, resulting in a relatively large moment of inertia (\\(I\\)). She spins at a certain angular velocity (\\(\\omega\\)). Her angular momentum is \\(L = I\\omega\\).\nWhen she pulls her arms and legs inward, she redistributes her mass closer to her axis of rotation. This action significantly decreases her moment of inertia (\\(I'\\)).\nSince the friction between her skates and the ice is very small, the net external torque on her is negligible, so her angular momentum must be conserved (\\(L_{initial} = L_{final}\\)).\nTherefore, to maintain the constant product \\(I\\omega\\), if \\(I\\) decreases, her angular velocity (\\(\\omega'\\) must increase dramatically. This is why she spins faster.\n\nAn interesting point often missed is what happens to her rotational kinetic energy (\\(K_{Rot} = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2\\)). When she pulls her arms in, her kinetic energy increases. This increase comes from the work she does to pull her arms inward against the centrifugal force. This work is converted into rotational kinetic energy. If she extends her arms again, she does negative work, and her kinetic energy returns to its original value, and her spin rate decreases.\n2. Formation of Solar Systems:\nOn a much grander scale, the formation of our solar system is a cosmic example of angular momentum conservation.\n\nOur solar system began as a vast, slowly rotating cloud of gas and dust (a nebula). This cloud had a certain initial angular momentum.\nOver time, gravitational forces caused this cloud to contract, pulling material inward.\nAs the cloud contracted, its overall moment of inertia (\\(I\\)) decreased (since mass moved closer to the center).\nTo conserve the total angular momentum (\\(L\\)), the rotation rate of the cloud increased. This increased rotation caused the cloud to flatten into a disk shape.\nEventually, the material in this spinning disk coalesced into the Sun (at the center) and the planets, all orbiting and spinning in the same general direction as the original cloud. This process ensures that the angular momentum of the initial nebula is conserved in the orbits and spins of the resulting celestial bodies.\n\nThese examples highlight the universal applicability and power of the conservation of angular momentum."

This motion is called precession.\nThe torque is perpendicular to the angular momentum vector, changing its direction but not its magnitude.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.20 (a) Non-spinning top falls. (b) Spinning top precesses.\n\n\nFigure 11.21 Torque perpendicular to \\(\\vec{L}\\) causes change in direction (\\(d\\vec{L}\\)), leading to precession.\n\n\nFinally, let’s explore the intriguing phenomenon of precession, primarily seen in gyroscopes.\nWhat is a Gyroscope? A gyroscope is essentially a spinning disk (or wheel) mounted in such a way that its axis of rotation is free to change direction. The key characteristic is that once spinning, the orientation of its spin axis remains remarkably stable, independent of the orientation of the object enclosing it. This stability makes gyroscopes indispensable in navigation systems for aircraft, spacecraft, missiles, and satellites, where a stable directional reference is crucial.\nThe Phenomenon of Precession:\nImagine a top.\n\nNon-spinning Top (Figure 11.20a): If you tilt a non-spinning top, gravity exerts a torque about its pivot point. This torque causes the top to simply fall over, rotating about a horizontal axis. The torque creates angular momentum in the direction of the fall.\nSpinning Top (Figure 11.20b and 11.21): If the top is spinning rapidly and you tilt it, something remarkable happens. Instead of falling over, its spin axis begins to slowly rotate around a vertical axis. This slow rotation of the spin axis itself is called precession.\n\nWhy does this happen?\nFigure 11.21 is key.\n\nTorque from Gravity (\\(\\vec{\\tau}\\)): Gravity (\\(Mg\\)) acts at the center of mass of the tilted top. This force, relative to the pivot point, creates a torque (\\(\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r} \\times Mg\\hat{j}\\)). The direction of this torque is horizontal and perpendicular to the spin axis of the top.\nAngular Momentum (\\(\\vec{L}\\)): The top already possesses a large angular momentum (\\(\\vec{L}\\)) along its spin axis due to its rapid rotation.\nRelationship between Torque and Angular Momentum: Remember the fundamental relationship: \\(\\frac{d\\vec{L}}{dt} = \\vec{\\tau}\\). This means the torque causes a change in the angular momentum vector (\\(\\Delta \\vec{L}\\)) in the same direction as the torque.\nDirectional Change, Not Magnitude: Since the torque is perpendicular to the initial angular momentum vector \\(\\vec{L}\\), it doesn’t change the magnitude of \\(\\vec{L}\\). Instead, it causes \\(\\vec{L}\\) to change its direction slightly. As time progresses, this continuous change in direction causes the tip of the \\(\\vec{L}\\) vector to trace out a circle in a horizontal plane, leading to the observed precession. The spin axis follows this change in direction.\n\nThis phenomenon explains why it’s easy to balance on a moving bicycle but hard on a stationary one, and why trying to reorient a spinning wheel (Figure 11.22) results in unexpected sideways movement. It’s the inherent resistance of the angular momentum vector to change its direction without an applied torque perpendicular to it."

This is the angular speed at which the spin axis itself rotates around the vertical (or precession) axis.\nDerivation Insight (referencing Figure 11.21):\n\nTorque Magnitude: The gravitational torque acting on the gyroscope is \\(\\tau = rMg\\sin\\theta\\), where \\(r\\) is the distance from the pivot to the center of mass, \\(M\\) is the mass, \\(g\\) is gravity, and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle the spin axis makes with the vertical.\nChange in Angular Momentum: We know that \\(\\tau = \\frac{dL}{dt}\\). The torque causes a change in the direction of the angular momentum vector \\(\\vec{L}\\). Over a small time interval \\(dt\\), the change in angular momentum \\(dL\\) is essentially an arc length in the horizontal plane (perpendicular to \\(\\vec{L}\\)).\nRelating Change to Precession Angle: This change \\(dL\\) corresponds to a small angle \\(d\\phi\\) through which the angular momentum vector (and thus the spin axis) precesses. From the geometry, \\(dL = (L\\sin\\theta)d\\phi\\). This is because \\(L\\sin\\theta\\) is the component of \\(\\vec{L}\\) perpendicular to the vertical precession axis, and \\(dL\\) is tangent to the circle it traces.\nCombining and Solving:\n\nSubstitute \\(\\tau\\) and \\(dL\\): \\(rMg\\sin\\theta = (L\\sin\\theta)\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}\\).\nNotice \\(\\sin\\theta\\) cancels out (unless \\(\\theta=0\\) or \\(\\theta=180\\), meaning the axis is vertical and there is no precession).\nWe get \\(rMg = L\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}\\).\nSince \\(\\omega_P = \\frac{d\\phi}{dt}\\), we have: \\(\\omega_P = \\frac{rMg}{L}\\)\nAnd, recalling that \\(L = I\\omega\\) (where \\(\\omega\\) is the spin angular velocity of the disk), we can also write: \\(\\omega_P = \\frac{rMg}{I\\omega}\\)\n\n\nImportant Assumptions and Conditions:\n\nThis formula assumes that the precessional angular velocity (\\(\\omega_P\\)) is much smaller than the spin angular velocity (\\(\\omega\\)) of the gyroscope disk (\\(\\omega_P \\ll \\omega\\)). If \\(\\omega_P\\) is comparable to \\(\\omega\\), the motion becomes more complex, including an oscillatory motion called nutation (a slight bobbing up and down as it precesses).\nThe formula clearly shows that precession is faster for heavier gyroscopes, for larger distances to the center of mass, and for slower spins (smaller \\(\\omega\\)). A faster spinning gyroscope precesses more slowly, indicating greater stability.\n\nEarth’s Precession:\nA grand example of precession is Earth itself. Earth is not a perfect sphere, and the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon exert torques on its equatorial bulge. This causes Earth’s axis of rotation to slowly precess, tracing a cone in space. This precession cycle takes approximately 26,000 years, meaning that over long periods, the “North Star” (the star closest to the celestial north pole) changes. Currently, Polaris is our North Star, but in about 13,000 years, Vega will be. This fascinating celestial motion is governed by the same physics as a simple spinning top."

Think of a wheel moving along the ground.\nRolling Without Slipping: This is a specific and ideal condition of rolling motion where the point of the object in contact with the surface is instantaneously at rest. This implies that static friction is at play, and no energy is lost due to sliding.\nRolling With Slipping: In contrast, this occurs when the contact point between the object and the surface is moving relative to the surface. Kinetic friction acts here, and mechanical energy is typically dissipated as heat.\nAngular Momentum (\\(\\vec{l}\\) or \\(\\vec{L}\\)): This is the rotational equivalent of linear momentum. For a single particle, it’s defined as the cross product of its position vector and linear momentum (\\(\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p}\\)). For a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis, its magnitude is the product of its moment of inertia and angular velocity (\\(I\\omega\\)). It’s a vector quantity.\nConservation of Angular Momentum: This is a very important principle. It states that the total angular momentum of a system remains constant (is conserved) if there is no net external torque acting on that system. This explains why ice skaters spin faster or why planets orbit as they do.\nGyroscope: This is a device, typically a rapidly spinning disk, mounted such that its axis of rotation can freely change orientation in space. Its stability makes it useful in navigation.\nPrecession: This is the phenomenon where the axis of a spinning object slowly rotates around another axis. It happens when a torque is applied perpendicular to the object’s angular momentum vector, causing the direction of the angular momentum to change over time, but not its magnitude.\nNutation: Often observed along with precession, nutation is a secondary, oscillatory or wobbling motion superimposed on the precessional path of a spinning object’s axis. It occurs when the precessional speed is not negligible compared to the spin speed, or when torques are not perfectly constant.\n\nUnderstanding these terms is crucial for grasping the concepts and solving problems in rotational dynamics."

His laws of motion, along with his law of gravity and the invention of calculus, laid the foundation for classical mechanics. These laws are incredibly broad and simple, applying across vast scales, from everyday objects to celestial bodies.

Field forces, on the other hand, don’t require contact. Gravity is the most common example in classical mechanics; Earth exerts a gravitational force on you even when you’re jumping in the air. Electromagnetic forces are also field forces, responsible for static electricity, magnetism, and even the atomic interactions that give rise to contact forces at a microscopic level.

It states that objects tend to maintain their state of motion. If something is at rest, it stays at rest. If it’s moving, it keeps moving at the same speed in the same direction. The crucial part is “unless acted on by a net external force.” This means that if an object’s velocity changes – whether its speed or its direction – there must be an external force responsible for that change. Friction is a common external force that slows objects down in our everyday experience. Without friction, an object would continue moving indefinitely."

If a frame is accelerating, then an object with no net force on it would appear to accelerate, violating the first law. For practical purposes in this course, we’ll generally treat Earth as an inertial frame, even though it technically accelerates due to its rotation and orbit.

Friction is a resistive force that always opposes motion or the tendency of motion between surfaces in contact. We’ll dedicate more time to friction in the next chapter. Spring force is unique to elastic objects like springs. It’s a restoring force that pushes or pulls the spring back to its original, relaxed position. Hooke’s Law describes this force, stating it’s proportional to the displacement from the relaxed state and acts in the opposite direction of that displacement."

First, clearly define and isolate your object of interest, representing it simply, often as a point. Second, identify all the external forces acting on that object. This means forces from its surroundings, like gravity, surface contact forces, or tension from ropes. Remember, internal forces or forces the object exerts on others are excluded. You also don’t draw the net force itself; the FBD helps you find the net force. Third, if forces are at angles, it’s often helpful to resolve them into their x and y components, aligning your axes to simplify calculations. Finally, for problems with multiple interacting objects, draw a separate FBD for each object. A helpful tip is to draw the acceleration vector nearby but distinct from the FBD to remind you of the object’s overall motion."

There’s its weight pulling down, the normal force from the snow pushing up, the tension from the rope pulling it at an angle, and friction from the snow opposing its motion. The diagram shows how these forces are represented as vectors from the central point. If we then decide to resolve the angled pulling force into horizontal and vertical components, we would indicate that the original vector has been replaced by its components."

It means that the center of mass of an isolated system moves with constant velocity, even if the individual parts of the system are moving chaotically, colliding, or exploding. This simplifies the analysis of complex systems dramatically, allowing us to track the system as a whole."

Its center of mass follows a parabolic trajectory (after engine cutoff).\nAt explosion: Internal forces cause fragments to fly apart. These internal forces sum to zero.\nAfter explosion: The velocity of the center of mass of the entire system of fragments continues on the exact same parabolic trajectory as the shell would have followed, ignoring air resistance.\nEach fragment then follows its own parabolic trajectory.\n\n\nCaption: Exploding fireworks are a vivid example of conservation of momentum and the motion of the center of mass.\n\nThis visually stunning example reinforces the concept that internal forces do not affect the motion of the center of mass. The explosion is a dramatic internal interaction, but it doesn’t change the overall trajectory of the system’s center of mass."

We must use the general form of Newton’s second law (\\(\\vec{F}_{net} = d\\vec{p}/dt\\)) to analyze it. The key is to consider the system as the rocket plus the fuel being ejected at a given instant, ensuring that the total mass of this instantaneous system is conserved, even though the rocket’s mass changes."

It shows that to achieve a large change in velocity (delta-v), you need a high exhaust velocity and/or a very large mass ratio (meaning a lot of fuel compared to the empty rocket). The logarithmic dependence means that as the mass ratio increases, each additional unit of fuel provides a proportionally smaller increase in delta-v."
