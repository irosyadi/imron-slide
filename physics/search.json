It’s often useful to note that for symmetric free fall motion, the time to reach the peak is half the total flight time. The answer to question 4 is crucial: acceleration due to gravity never changes during free fall, even when the instantaneous velocity is zero at the peak. The object is still under the influence of gravity and its velocity is continuously changing."

Speed increases linearly with time (\\(v \\propto t\\)).\nDistance Traveled: \\(y = y_0 + v_0t + \\frac{1}{2}at^2 \\implies y = \\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\) (since \\(y_0=0, v_0=0\\)). Distance increases quadratically with time (\\(y \\propto t^2\\)).\n\nTherefore, the distance traveled increases faster than the speed of the ice chunk.\n\nUsing a downward positive coordinate system simplifies the sign of ‘g’. The time to fall 30 meters is just under 2.5 seconds. For part 2, it’s a conceptual question about the functional forms. Distance grows quadratically with time (t-squared), while speed grows linearly with time. So, as time progresses, the distance covered increases much more rapidly. This is a common characteristic of constantly accelerated motion."

These principles are fundamental for understanding and designing anything that moves through the air or falls under gravity, from bridge structures to rocket trajectories."
