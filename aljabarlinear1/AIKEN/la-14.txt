C. Matrix multiplication is distributive over addition.
D. Matrix multiplication is associative.
ANSWER: B
Consider the statement: "If \(AB = AC\) and \(A \neq 0\), then \(B = C\)". Is this statement generally true for matrices?
A. Yes, it is always true.
B. No, it is generally false.
C. It is true only if A is a diagonal matrix.
D. It is true only if B and C are scalar matrices.
ANSWER: B
If \(A\) and \(B\) are nonzero matrices, can their product \(AB\) be a zero matrix?
A. No, if A and B are nonzero, AB must be nonzero.
B. Yes, AB can be a zero matrix even if A and B are nonzero.
C. Only if A is a scalar multiple of B.
D. Only if B is a scalar multiple of A.
ANSWER: B
In matrix arithmetic, what is the role of an identity matrix \(I\)?
A. It acts as the additive inverse, resulting in a zero matrix.
B. It acts as the multiplicative identity, similar to the number 1 for real numbers.
C. It transforms any matrix into its transpose.
D. It indicates that the matrix is singular.
ANSWER: B
A square matrix \(A\) is considered invertible (or nonsingular) if:
A. Its determinant is zero.
B. It has an inverse matrix \(B\) such that \(AB = BA = I\).
C. All its entries are non-zero.
D. It has more columns than rows.
ANSWER: B
What can be said about a square matrix that has a row or column of zeros?

B. Infinitely many.
C. Exactly one.
D. At least two.
ANSWER: C
