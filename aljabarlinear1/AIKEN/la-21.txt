What is the definition of the minor \(M_{ij}\) of an entry \(a_{ij}\) in a square matrix \(A\)?
A. It is the entry \(a_{ji}\).
B. It is the determinant of the submatrix resulting from deleting the \(i\)-th row and \(j\)-th column from \(A\).
C. It is the entry \(a_{ij}\) multiplied by \( (-1)^{i+j} \).

ANSWER: B
How is the cofactor \(C_{ij}\) of an entry \(a_{ij}\) related to its minor \(M_{ij}\)?
A. \( C_{ij} = M_{ij} / (-1)^{i+j} \)
B. \( C_{ij} = M_{ij} \)
C. \( C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} \cdot M_{ij} \)
D. \( C_{ij} = M_{ij} + (-1)^{i+j} \)
ANSWER: C
What visual pattern do the signs \( (-1)^{i+j} \) for cofactors follow within a matrix?
A. Alternating signs starting with minus (-) in the top-left corner.
B. All signs are positive.
C. A checkerboard pattern of plus (+) and minus (-) signs.
D. Signs are determined by whether the matrix is square or rectangular.
ANSWER: C
What is generally the most efficient strategy for performing a cofactor expansion to evaluate a determinant?

B. Always expand along the last column.
C. Expand along a row or column that contains the maximum number of zero entries.
D. Expand along the main diagonal entries only.
ANSWER: C
For an \(n \times n\) triangular matrix (upper, lower, or diagonal), how is its determinant calculated?

Given a \(2 \times 2\) matrix \(A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}\), what is the formula for its inverse \(A^{-1}\) in terms of its determinant?
A. \( A^{-1} = \operatorname{det}(A) \begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{bmatrix} \)
B. \( A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\operatorname{det}(A)} \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix} \)
C. \( A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\operatorname{det}(A)} \begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{bmatrix} \)
D. \( A^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad+bc} \begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{bmatrix} \)
ANSWER: C
