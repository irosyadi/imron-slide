What are the possible numbers of solutions for any system of linear equations?
A. Zero or two
B. Exactly one or exactly two
C. One, two, or infinitely many
D. Zero, one, or infinitely many
ANSWER: D
When is the solution of a linear system \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} \) given by the formula \( \mathbf{x} = A^{-1}\mathbf{b} \)?
A. When A is any square matrix.
B. When A is an invertible n x n matrix.
C. When A is a singular matrix.
D. When b is the zero vector.
ANSWER: B
What is an efficient way to solve a sequence of linear systems \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}_1, A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}_2, \ldots, A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}_k \) that share the same square coefficient matrix A?
A. Solve each system individually using Gauss-Jordan elimination.
B. Form a partitioned matrix \( [A\mid \mathbf{b}_1\mid \mathbf{b}_2\mid \dots \mid \mathbf{b}_k] \) and reduce it to reduced row echelon form.
C. Calculate \( A^{-1} \) once, then multiply by each \( \mathbf{b}_i \) one by one, even if A is not invertible.
D. This method is only applicable if A is a diagonal matrix.
ANSWER: B
According to Theorem 1.6.3, if A is a square matrix and B is a square matrix satisfying \( BA = I \), what does B represent?
A. The identity matrix.
B. The zero matrix.
C. The inverse of A, i.e., \( A^{-1} \).
D. The transpose of A, i.e., \( A^T \).
ANSWER: C
Which of the following statements is NOT equivalent to an n x n matrix A being invertible?
A. The system \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} \) has only the trivial solution.
B. The reduced row echelon form of A is the identity matrix \( I_n \).
C. The system \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} \) is consistent for every n x 1 matrix \( \mathbf{b} \).
D. The system \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} \) has no solution for some n x 1 matrix \( \mathbf{b} \).
ANSWER: D
If A and B are square matrices of the same size and their product AB is invertible, what can be concluded about Matrices A and B individually?
A. Only A must be invertible.
B. Only B must be invertible.
C. Neither A nor B must be invertible.
D. Both A and B must be invertible.
ANSWER: D
When an m x n matrix A is not square, or is square but not invertible, what is generally true regarding the consistency of the linear system \( A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} \)?
A. The system is always consistent for any \( \mathbf{b} \).
B. The system is always inconsistent.
C. The vector \( \mathbf{b} \) must satisfy certain conditions for the system to be consistent.
D. The system always has a unique solution.
