What is the determinant of a square matrix that has a row of zeros?
A. It is always undefined.
B. It is always 1.
C. It is always 0.
D. It depends on the other entries in the matrix.
ANSWER: C
How does transposing a square matrix \(A\) affect its determinant?
A. \( \operatorname{det}(A) = -\operatorname{det}(A^T) \)
B. \( \operatorname{det}(A) \) becomes its reciprocal, \( 1/\operatorname{det}(A^T) \).
C. Transposing a matrix does not change its determinant; \( \operatorname{det}(A) = \operatorname{det}(A^T) \).
D. The determinant becomes its complex conjugate.
ANSWER: C
If a matrix \(B\) is formed by multiplying a single row of matrix \(A\) by a scalar \(k\), what is the relationship between \( \operatorname{det}(B) \) and \( \operatorname{det}(A) \)?
A. \( \operatorname{det}(B) = \operatorname{det}(A) \)
B. \( \operatorname{det}(B) = k \cdot \operatorname{det}(A) \)
C. \( \operatorname{det}(B) = \operatorname{det}(A) / k \)
D. \( \operatorname{det}(B) = k + \operatorname{det}(A) \)
ANSWER: B
If a matrix \(B\) is formed by interchanging two rows of matrix \(A\), what is the relationship between \( \operatorname{det}(B) \) and \( \operatorname{det}(A) \)?
A. \( \operatorname{det}(B) = \operatorname{det}(A) \)
B. \( \operatorname{det}(B) = -\operatorname{det}(A) \)
C. \( \operatorname{det}(B) = 2 \cdot \operatorname{det}(A) \)
D. \( \operatorname{det}(B) = 1/\operatorname{det}(A) \)
ANSWER: B
If a matrix \(B\) is formed by adding a multiple of one row of matrix \(A\) to another row, what is the relationship between \( \operatorname{det}(B) \) and \( \operatorname{det}(A) \)?
A. \( \operatorname{det}(B) = \operatorname{det}(A) \)
B. \( \operatorname{det}(B) = \operatorname{det}(A) + k \) (where k is the multiple)
C. \( \operatorname{det}(B) = -\operatorname{det}(A) \)
D. \( \operatorname{det}(B) = 0 \)
ANSWER: A

What is the determinant of a square matrix that has two proportional rows or columns?
A. It is always 1.
B. It is always 0.
C. It is always negative.
D. It is undefined.
ANSWER: B
For large matrices, why is evaluating determinants by row reduction often preferred over cofactor expansion?
A. Row reduction is only applicable to square matrices.
B. Row reduction requires significantly less computation.
C. Row reduction does not change the sign of the determinant.
D. Cofactor expansion is only for \(2 \times 2\) matrices.
ANSWER: B
