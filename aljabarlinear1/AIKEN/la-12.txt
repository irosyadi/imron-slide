Which of the following is NOT a property required for a matrix to be in reduced row echelon form?
A. If a row does not consist entirely of zeros, its first nonzero number is a 1 (leading 1).
B. If there are any rows that consist entirely of zeros, they are grouped at the top of the matrix.
C. In any two successive nonzero rows, the leading 1 in the lower row occurs farther to the right than the leading 1 in the higher row.
D. Each column that contains a leading 1 has zeros everywhere else in that column.
ANSWER: B
A matrix that has the first three properties of reduced row echelon form (but not necessarily the fourth) is said to be in what form?
A. Normal form
B. Canonical form
C. Row echelon form
D. Identity form
ANSWER: C
What is the key difference between a matrix in row echelon form and one in reduced row echelon form?
A. Row echelon form has only zeros above leading 1s, while reduced row echelon form has zeros below leading 1s.
B. Reduced row echelon form has zeros below and above each leading 1, while row echelon form only guarantees zeros below.
C. Row echelon form allows for non-zero entries in columns containing leading 1s, while reduced row echelon form does not.
D. Reduced row echelon form must have all rows of zeros at the bottom, unlike row echelon form.
ANSWER: B
