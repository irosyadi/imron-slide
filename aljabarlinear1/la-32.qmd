# Linear Algebra for ECE
**Norm, Dot Product, and Distance**

---

## Introduction
In this section, we explore concepts of **length** and **distance** as they apply to vectors.
We'll start with familiar 2D and 3D spaces, then generalize these ideas algebraically to $R^n$.

::: {.notes}
Connecting geometric intuition from 2D and 3D with the abstract world of $n$-space is a key theme in linear algebra.
These concepts are fundamental for understanding vector spaces, optimization, and many signal processing techniques in ECE.
For example, signal power relates to vector norm, and signal similarity relates to the dot product.
:::

## Norm of a Vector
The length of a vector $\mathbf{v}$ is called its **norm**, denoted by $\| \mathbf{v}\|$.
It's also referred to as the length or magnitude of $\mathbf{v}$.

**In $R^2$ (Pythagorean Theorem):**
For $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2)$,
$$
\| \mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2} \tag{1}
$$

**In $R^3$ (Pythagorean Theorem twice):**
For $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, v_3)$,
$$
\| \mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + v_3^2} \tag{2}
$$

::: {.notes}
The norm is essentially the distance from the origin to the vector's terminal point.
It's a direct generalization of the Pythagorean theorem.
In ECE, the norm of a signal vector can represent its energy or power.
:::

---

## Norm in $R^n$ (Definition 1)
For a vector $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n)$ in $R^n$, its norm is defined as:

$$
\| \mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \cdots + v_n^2} \tag{3}
$$

### EXAMPLE 1: Calculating Norms
-   Norm of $\mathbf{v} = (-3, 2, 1)$ in $R^3$:
    $$
    \| \mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 1} = \sqrt{14}
    $$
-   Norm of $\mathbf{v} = (2, -1, 3, -5)$ in $R^4$:
    $$
    \| \mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2 + 3^2 + (-5)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1 + 9 + 25} = \sqrt{39}
    $$

::: {.notes}
This definition extends the Pythagorean theorem to any number of dimensions.
It's a scalar value, always non-negative.
The examples show how straightforward the calculation is, even for higher dimensions.

```

This interactive tool allows you to compute the norm for any vector in $R^n$.
Just modify the `vector_str` variable in the code block and click run.
This helps reinforce the calculation and shows how NumPy handles it efficiently.

## Properties of the Norm (Theorem 3.2.1)
For a vector $\mathbf{v}$ in $R^n$ and any scalar $k$:

(a) $\| \mathbf{v}\| \geq 0$  (Norm is non-negative)
(b) $\| \mathbf{v}\| = 0$ if and only if $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$  (Only the zero vector has zero norm)
(c) $\| k\mathbf{v}\| = |k| \| \mathbf{v}\|$  (Scaling a vector scales its norm by the absolute value of the scalar)

**Proof (c):**
If $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, \ldots, v_n)$, then $k\mathbf{v} = (kv_1, \ldots, kv_n)$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\| k\mathbf{v}\| &= \sqrt{(kv_1)^2 + (kv_2)^2 + \cdots + (kv_n)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{k^2 v_1^2 + k^2 v_2^2 + \cdots + k^2 v_n^2} \\
&= \sqrt{k^2(v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \cdots + v_n^2)} \\
&= \sqrt{k^2} \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \cdots + v_n^2} \\
&= |k| \| \mathbf{v}\|
\end{aligned}
$$

::: {.notes}
These properties are intuitive extensions of what we know about length.
Property (c) is particularly important for understanding how scaling affects a vector's magnitude.
It means that if you double a vector, its length doubles; if you negate a vector, its length remains the same.
:::

---

## Unit Vectors
A vector with a norm of 1 is called a **unit vector**.
Unit vectors are useful for specifying direction without concern for length.

To obtain a unit vector $\mathbf{u}$ that has the same direction as a nonzero vector $\mathbf{v}$, we **normalize** $\mathbf{v}$:
$$
\mathbf{u} = \frac{1}{\| \mathbf{v}\|} \mathbf{v} \tag{4}
$$

::: {.callout-warning}
**Notation Alert:** You might also see this written as $\mathbf{u} = \frac{\mathbf{v}}{\| \mathbf{v}\|}$. This is just a compact way of writing the scalar multiplication, not actual vector division.
:::

We can confirm $\| \mathbf{u}\| = 1$ using Theorem 3.2.1(c):
$$
\| \mathbf{u}\| = \left\| \frac{1}{\| \mathbf{v}\|} \mathbf{v} \right\| = \left| \frac{1}{\| \mathbf{v}\|} \right| \| \mathbf{v}\| = \frac{1}{\| \mathbf{v}\|} \| \mathbf{v}\| = 1
$$

::: {.notes}
Unit vectors are crucial in many ECE applications, such as defining directions for antennas, forces, or normalizing data to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating analyses.
Normalizing a vector makes it a unit vector while preserving its direction.
:::

---

## EXAMPLE 2: Normalizing a Vector
Find the unit vector $\mathbf{u}$ that has the same direction as $\mathbf{v} = (2, 2, -1)$.

**Solution:**
First, find the norm of $\mathbf{v}$:
$$
\| \mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + 2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 4 + 1} = \sqrt{9} = 3
$$
Now, normalize $\mathbf{v}$:
$$
\mathbf{u} = \frac{1}{3} (2, 2, -1) = \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, -\frac{1}{3}\right)
$$
You can verify that $\| \mathbf{u}\| = \sqrt{(2/3)^2 + (2/3)^2 + (-1/3)^2} = \sqrt{4/9 + 4/9 + 1/9} = \sqrt{9/9} = 1$.

::: {.notes}
This example clearly shows the two steps: calculate the norm, then divide each component by the norm.
The check confirms that the resulting vector indeed has a length of 1.
:::

## Interactive Vector Normalization
Enter a vector in $R^n$ and normalize it.

```{pyodide}
#| max-lines: 10

import numpy as np

# Enter vector components here, e.g., "2, 2, -1" or "5, 0, 12"
vector_str_norm = "2, 2, -1" # Try changing this!

try:
    v_comp_norm = [float(x.strip()) for x in vector_str_norm.split(',')]
    v_norm = np.array(v_comp_norm)

    if np.linalg.norm(v_norm) == 0:
        print("Cannot normalize the zero vector.")
    else:
        unit_v = v_norm / np.linalg.norm(v_norm)
        print(f"Original Vector v: {tuple(v_comp_norm)}")
        print(f"Norm of v (||v||): {np.linalg.norm(v_norm):.4f}")
        print(f"Unit Vector u (normalized v): {tuple(unit_v.round(4))}")
        print(f"Norm of u (||u||): {np.linalg.norm(unit_v):.4f}")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter comma-separated numbers.")
```

::: {.notes}
Use this code block to practice normalizing vectors.
Input different vectors, including those with fractions or higher dimensions.
Observe that the output `u` always has a norm of 1 (or very close due to floating-point precision).
:::

---

## The Standard Unit Vectors
These are unit vectors along the positive coordinate axes.

**In $R^2$:**
$\mathbf{i} = (1,0)$ and $\mathbf{j} = (0,1)$

**In $R^3$:**
$\mathbf{i} = (1,0,0)$, $\mathbf{j} = (0,1,0)$, and $\mathbf{k} = (0,0,1)$

Any vector $\mathbf{v}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of these:

-   **$R^2$:** $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2) = v_1\mathbf{i} + v_2\mathbf{j}$ (Eq. 5)
-   **$R^3$:** $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, v_3) = v_1\mathbf{i} + v_2\mathbf{j} + v_3\mathbf{k}$ (Eq. 6)

::: {.notes}
Standard unit vectors form a fundamental basis for $R^2$ and $R^3$.
They are mutually orthogonal and have unit length.
This representation is very common in physics and engineering for breaking down forces or fields into their orthogonal components.
:::

---

## Standard Unit Vectors in $R^n$
The concept extends to $R^n$:

$$
\mathbf{e}_1 = (1,0,0,\ldots,0), \quad \mathbf{e}_2 = (0,1,0,\ldots,0), \quad \ldots, \quad \mathbf{e}_n = (0,0,0,\ldots,1) \tag{7}
$$
Any vector $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n)$ in $R^n$ can be expressed as:
$$
\mathbf{v} = v_1\mathbf{e}_1 + v_2\mathbf{e}_2 + \dots + v_n\mathbf{e}_n \tag{8}
$$

### EXAMPLE 3: Linear Combinations of Standard Unit Vectors
-   $(2, -3, 4) = 2\mathbf{i} - 3\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}$
-   $(7, 3, -4, 5) = 7\mathbf{e}_1 + 3\mathbf{e}_2 - 4\mathbf{e}_3 + 5\mathbf{e}_4$

::: {.notes}
The standard unit vectors $\{\mathbf{e}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_n\}$ form the **standard basis** for $R^n$.
They are incredibly useful because they simplify many calculations and provide a clear way to represent any vector.
In signal processing, these can represent basis functions or orthogonal components of a signal.
:::

---

## Distance in $R^n$
The distance between two points $P_1$ and $P_2$ is the length of the vector $\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}$.

**In $R^2$:** For $P_1(x_1,y_1)$ and $P_2(x_2,y_2)$,
$$
d = \| \overrightarrow{P_1P_2}\| = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \tag{9}
$$
**In $R^3$:** For $P_1(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $P_2(x_2,y_2,z_2)$,
$$
d = \| \overrightarrow{P_1P_2}\| = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2} \tag{10}
$$

![Figure 3.2.3: Distance between two points in $R^2$.](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-08-19/f59e50f2-8dda-4dce-b79e-a9918d3c60b5/6af15deb36b7def7433c12f96effe7ca8dbea211215c38abac3dba753d880882.jpg)

::: {.notes}
The distance formula is a direct application of the norm of the difference vector between two points.
This is a fundamental concept in geometry and has vast applications in ECE, such as calculating the distance between sensor readings, or the error between an actual and desired output.
:::

---

## Distance in $R^n$ (Definition 2)
For points $\mathbf{u} = (u_1, \ldots, u_n)$ and $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, \ldots, v_n)$ in $R^n$, the distance $d(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$ is:

$$
d(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}) = \| \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{(u_1 - v_1)^2 + (u_2 - v_2)^2 + \cdots + (u_n - v_n)^2} \tag{11}
$$

### EXAMPLE 4: Calculating Distance in $R^n$
If $\mathbf{u} = (1, 3, -2, 7)$ and $\mathbf{v} = (0, 7, 2, 2)$, then the distance is:
$$
\begin{aligned}
d(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}) &= \sqrt{(1 - 0)^2 + (3 - 7)^2 + (-2 - 2)^2 + (7 - 2)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{1^2 + (-4)^2 + (-4)^2 + 5^2} \\
&= \sqrt{1 + 16 + 16 + 25} = \sqrt{58}
\end{aligned}
$$

::: {.notes}
This formal definition shows that distance in $R^n$ is simply the norm of the vector representing the displacement from one point to another.
The example illustrates the calculation for points in $R^4$.

This interactive tool lets you compute the distance between any two points in $R^n$.

## Dot Product: Geometric Definition
To define the "angle" between vectors, we use the **dot product**.

For nonzero vectors $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}$ in $R^2$ or $R^3$ (with initial points coinciding), the angle $\theta$ ($0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$) between them is shown below:

![Figure 3.2.4: Angle between two vectors.](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-08-19/f59e50f2-8dda-4dce-b79e-a9918d3c60b5/870d5ebb694d51f3645d51d9105337cdf1518a45388da9f0264f329f52e6ff85.jpg)

**Definition 3 (Geometric Dot Product):**
$$
\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} = \| \mathbf{u}\| \| \mathbf{v}\| \cos \theta \tag{12}
$$
If $\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{0}$ or $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$, then $\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} = 0$.

::: {.notes}
The dot product is a scalar value that captures the relationship between two vectors in terms of their magnitudes and the angle between them.
It's a foundational concept in physics (e.g., work done by a force) and ECE (e.g., correlation between signals).
:::

---

## Angle from Dot Product
From the geometric definition, we can find the angle:
$$
\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}}{\| \mathbf{u}\| \| \mathbf{v}\|} \tag{13}
$$
Since $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$:

-   $\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} > 0 \implies \theta$ is **acute** ($0 < \theta < \pi/2$)
-   $\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} < 0 \implies \theta$ is **obtuse** ($\pi/2 < \theta < \pi$)
-   $\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} = 0 \implies \theta = \pi/2$ (**orthogonal** vectors)

![Figure 3.2.5: Angle types based on dot product sign.](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-08-19/f59e50f2-8dda-4dce-b79e-a9918d3c60b5/d7191441c5046a399fa9f65cf167a33accf17f17e325d06457f80e5bb44412ba.jpg)

::: {.notes}
The sign of the dot product tells us a lot about the orientation of the vectors.
Orthogonality (vectors at 90 degrees) is especially important in ECE for concepts like independent signals or perpendicular fields.
If two signals have a dot product of zero, they are uncorrelated.
:::

---

## EXAMPLE 5: Dot Product (Geometric)
Find the dot product of the vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ shown in Figure 3.2.5.

The lengths are:

$\| \mathbf{u}\| = 1$

$\| \mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}$

The angle between them is $\theta = 45^\circ$, so $\cos(45^\circ) = 1/\sqrt{2}$.

Thus,
$$
\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} = \| \mathbf{u}\| \| \mathbf{v}\| \cos \theta = (1)(2\sqrt{2})(1/\sqrt{2}) = 2
$$

::: {.notes}
This example uses the geometric definition directly.
It's a good way to visualize what the dot product means before we move to the component-wise calculation.
:::

---

## Component Form of the Dot Product
For computational purposes, we need a formula in terms of components.
Using the Law of Cosines for the triangle formed by $\mathbf{u}$, $\mathbf{v}$, and $\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u}$:

![Figure 3.2.6: Derivation of component form of dot product.](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-08-19/f59e50f2-8dda-4dce-b79e-a9918d3c60b5/40ad58acaeba25b9c271e572286f5579d41f7f23c0179251605e6cc0843b0225.jpg)

This leads to:
-   **In $R^2$:** $\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2$ (Eq. 16)
-   **In $R^3$:** $\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + u_3v_3$ (Eq. 15)

::: {.notes}
The derivation, though not fully shown here, is an important connection between geometry and algebra.
It demonstrates that the component-wise definition is consistent with the geometric one.
:::

---

## Dot Product in $R^n$ (Definition 4)
For vectors $\mathbf{u} = (u_1, \ldots, u_n)$ and $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, \ldots, v_n)$ in $R^n$, the **dot product** is:

$$
\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + \dots + u_nv_n \tag{17}
$$
**In words:** Multiply corresponding components and add the products.

### EXAMPLE 6: Calculating Dot Products Using Components
(a) For $\mathbf{u} = (0,0,1)$ and $\mathbf{v} = (0,2,2)$ (from Example 5):
    $$
    \mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} = (0)(0) + (0)(2) + (1)(2) = 2
    $$
    (This agrees with the geometric calculation.)
(b) For $\mathbf{u} = (-1,3,5,7)$ and $\mathbf{v} = (-3,-4,1,0)$ in $R^4$:
    $$
    \mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} = (-1)(-3) + (3)(-4) + (5)(1) + (7)(0) = 3 - 12 + 5 + 0 = -4
    $$

::: {.notes}
This component-wise definition is the most practical for computation.
It's simple, efficient, and extends perfectly to $n$-dimensions.
In ECE, this is how inner products are typically computed in digital signal processing, control systems, and machine learning algorithms.

## EXAMPLE 7: A Geometry Problem Solved Using Dot Product
Find the angle between a diagonal of a cube and one of its edges.

Let the cube have edge length $k$.
Place one vertex at the origin $(0,0,0)$.
-   An edge vector: $\mathbf{u}_1 = (k,0,0)$
-   A diagonal vector (from origin to opposite corner): $\mathbf{d} = (k,k,k)$

Using the formula $\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}}{\| \mathbf{u}\| \| \mathbf{v}\|}$:
$$
\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{u}_1\cdot\mathbf{d}}{\| \mathbf{u}_1\| \| \mathbf{d}\|} = \frac{(k)(k) + (0)(k) + (0)(k)}{\sqrt{k^2}\sqrt{k^2+k^2+k^2}} = \frac{k^2}{k\sqrt{3k^2}} = \frac{k^2}{k(k\sqrt{3})} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
$$
$$
\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \approx 54.74^{\circ}

## Algebraic Properties of the Dot Product

**Relationship between Norm and Dot Product:**
$$
\mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{v} = v_1^2 + \dots + v_n^2 = \| \mathbf{v}\|^2 \tag{18}
$$
So, $\| \mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{\mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{v}}$ (Eq. 19)

**Theorem 3.2.2:** For $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}$ in $R^n$, scalar $k$:

(a) $\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{u}$ (Symmetry)

(b) $\mathbf{u}\cdot (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{w}$ (Distributive)

(c) $k(\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v}) = (k\mathbf{u})\cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{u}\cdot (k\mathbf{v})$ (Homogeneity)

(d) $\mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{v} \geq 0$ and $\mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{v} = 0$ iff $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$

**Theorem 3.2.3 (Additional Properties):**

(a) $\mathbf{0}\cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{0} = 0$

(b) $(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v})\cdot \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{w}$

(c) $\mathbf{u}\cdot (\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} - \mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{w}$

(d) $(\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v})\cdot \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{w} - \mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{w}$

::: {.notes}
These theorems establish the algebraic rules for working with dot products.
They are crucial for simplifying expressions and proving other theorems without always resorting to component-wise calculations.
They are analogous to the properties of multiplication of real numbers.
:::

## EXAMPLE 8: Calculating with Dot Products
Simplify $(\mathbf{u} - 2\mathbf{v})\cdot (3\mathbf{u} + 4\mathbf{v})$.

Using distributive and homogeneity properties:
$$
\begin{aligned}
(\mathbf{u} - 2\mathbf{v})\cdot (3\mathbf{u} + 4\mathbf{v}) &= \mathbf{u}\cdot (3\mathbf{u} + 4\mathbf{v}) - 2\mathbf{v}\cdot (3\mathbf{u} + 4\mathbf{v}) \\
&= (3\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{u} + 4\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v}) - (6\mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{u} + 8\mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{v}) \\
&= 3(\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{u}) + 4(\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v}) - 6(\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v}) - 8(\mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{v}) & \text{[Symmetry: }\mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v}] \\
&= 3\| \mathbf{u}\|^2 - 2(\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v}) - 8\| \mathbf{v}\|^2 & \text{[Since }\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{x} = \| \mathbf{x}\|^2]
\end{aligned}
$$

::: {.notes}
This example shows how to algebraically expand and simplify expressions involving dot products.
It's a good exercise in applying the properties from Theorems 3.2.2 and 3.2.3.
This skill is vital for derivations in various ECE fields, such as optimizing controller gains or analyzing signal processing filter responses.

## Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
To define the angle in $R^n$ using $\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}}{\| \mathbf{u}\| \| \mathbf{v}\|}$, we need to ensure the argument of $\cos^{-1}$ is between -1 and 1.
This is guaranteed by the **Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**:

**Theorem 3.2.4 (Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality):**
If $\mathbf{u} = (u_1, \ldots, u_n)$ and $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, \ldots, v_n)$ are vectors in $R^n$, then:
$$
|\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v}|\leq \| \mathbf{u}\| \| \mathbf{v}\| \tag{22}
$$
Or in component form:
$$
|u_1v_1 + \dots + u_nv_n| \leq (u_1^2 + \dots + u_n^2)^{1/2}(v_1^2 + \dots + v_n^2)^{1/2} \tag{23}
$$

**Implication for Angle:**
Dividing by $\| \mathbf{u}\| \| \mathbf{v}\|$ (for nonzero vectors) gives:
$$
\left|\frac{\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}}{\| \mathbf{u}\| \| \mathbf{v}\|}\right|\leq 1 \quad \implies \quad -1 \leq \frac{\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}}{\| \mathbf{u}\| \| \mathbf{v}\|} \leq 1
$$
This confirms that the angle formula is well-defined for all nonzero vectors in $R^n$.

::: {.notes}
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is one of the most important inequalities in mathematics.
It has profound implications in many fields, including signal processing, information theory, and quantum mechanics in ECE.
It essentially states that the dot product of two vectors cannot exceed the product of their lengths.
Equality holds if and only if the vectors are collinear (one is a scalar multiple of the other).

## Triangle Inequality for Vectors and Distances
These generalize familiar geometric results.

**Theorem 3.2.5:** For vectors $\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}$ in $R^n$:
(a) $\| \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\| \leq \| \mathbf{u}\| + \| \mathbf{v}\|$ (Triangle inequality for vectors)
(b) $d(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})\leq d(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{w}) + d(\mathbf{w},\mathbf{v})$ (Triangle inequality for distances)

![Figure 3.2.8: Triangle inequality for vectors.](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-08-19/f59e50f2-8dda-4dce-b79e-a9918d3c60b5/02b403eb055df1a15b15c89b9aa97326f785916ac139a12f0e25fa8d50476c28.jpg)

## Triangle Inequality for Vectors and Distances

**Proof (a):**
Starting with $\| \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 = (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v})\cdot (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = \| \mathbf{u}\|^2 + 2(\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v}) + \| \mathbf{v}\|^2$.
Using $\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} \leq |\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v}|$ and Cauchy-Schwarz $|\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v}| \leq \| \mathbf{u}\| \| \mathbf{v}\|$:
$$
\| \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 \leq \| \mathbf{u}\|^2 + 2\| \mathbf{u}\| \| \mathbf{v}\| + \| \mathbf{v}\|^2 = (\| \mathbf{u}\| + \| \mathbf{v}\|)^2
$$
Taking the square root (both sides non-negative) gives the result.

::: {.notes}
The triangle inequality is a very intuitive geometric concept: the shortest path between two points is a straight line.
It's fundamental in metric spaces and has applications in network routing, error correction codes, and signal reconstruction in ECE.

## Parallelogram Equation
This theorem generalizes the property that the sum of the squares of the diagonals of a parallelogram equals the sum of the squares of its four sides.

**Theorem 3.2.6 (Parallelogram Equation):**
If $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are vectors in $R^n$, then:
$$
\| \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 + \| \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\|^2 = 2\left(\| \mathbf{u}\|^2 + \| \mathbf{v}\|^2\right) \tag{24}
$$

![Figure 3.2.10: Parallelogram formed by $\mathbf{u}$, $\mathbf{v}$, $\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}$, and $\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{v}$.](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-08-19/f59e50f2-8dda-4dce-b79e-a9918d3c60b5/a6387cb2ba8b9f1bf02735e779f9898248b7ad853680f3592b6a6606b1728bec.jpg)

**Theorem 3.2.7 (Dot Product from Norms):**
For vectors $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}$ in $R^n$:
$$
\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{4}\| \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 - \frac{1}{4}\| \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\|^2 \tag{25}
$$
This formula expresses the dot product solely in terms of norms.

::: {.notes}
The parallelogram equation provides an identity relating sums and differences of vectors to their norms.
Theorem 3.2.7 is particularly interesting as it defines the dot product purely from the concept of length, reinforcing the deep connections between these fundamental vector operations.
This is important in abstract vector spaces where an inner product (dot product generalization) might be defined through a norm.

## Dot Products as Matrix Multiplication
The dot product can be expressed using matrix notation, depending on whether vectors are row or column matrices.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
| Form                       | Dot Product      |
|:---------------------------|:-----------------|
| $\mathbf{u}$ column, $\mathbf{v}$ column | $\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{u}$ |
| $\mathbf{u}$ row, $\mathbf{v}$ column   | $\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{u}^T$ |
| $\mathbf{u}$ column, $\mathbf{v}$ row   | $\mathbf{v}\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{v}^T$ |
| $\mathbf{u}$ row, $\mathbf{v}$ row     | $\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}^T = \mathbf{v}\mathbf{u}^T$ |

*(Partial Table 1 from text)*

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Key Identities:**
For an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ and $n \times 1$ column vectors $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}$:
$$
A\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{u}\cdot A^T\mathbf{v} \tag{26}
$$
$$
\mathbf{u}\cdot A\mathbf{v} = A^T\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} \tag{27}
$$
These link matrix multiplication with the transpose.
:::

::: {.notes}
This section highlights the close relationship between dot products and matrix operations.
The identities involving the transpose are extremely important in proofs and algorithms in linear algebra, especially in optimization, least squares, and signal processing.
For instance, in machine learning, the gradient of a loss function often involves transposes and dot products.
:::

## EXAMPLE 9: Verifying $A\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{u}\cdot A^T\mathbf{v}$
Given:
$$
A={\left[\begin{array}{l l l}{1}&{-2}&{3}\\ {2}&{4}&{1}\\ {-1}&{0}&{1}\end{array}\right]}, \quad \mathbf{u}={\left[\begin{array}{l}{-1}\\ {2}\\ {4}\end{array}\right]}, \quad \mathbf{v}={\left[\begin{array}{l}{-2}\\ {0}\\ {5}\end{array}\right]}
$$
Calculate $A\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{u}\cdot A^T\mathbf{v}$.

**$A\mathbf{u}$ calculation:**
$$
A\mathbf{u}={\left[\begin{array}{l}{1(-1) - 2(2) + 3(4)}\\ {2(-1) + 4(2) + 1(4)}\\ {-1(-1) + 0(2) + 1(4)}\end{array}\right]}={\left[\begin{array}{l}{7}\\ {10}\\ {5}\end{array}\right]}
$$
Then $A\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} = (7)(-2) + (10)(0) + (5)(5) = -14 + 0 + 25 = 11$.

**$A^T\mathbf{v}$ calculation:**
$$
A^T={\left[\begin{array}{l l l}{1}&{2}&{-1}\\ {-2}&{4}&{0}\\ {3}&{1}&{1}\end{array}\right]} \implies A^T\mathbf{v}={\left[\begin{array}{l}{1(-2) + 2(0) - 1(5)}\\ {-2(-2) + 4(0) + 0(5)}\\ {3(-2) + 1(0) + 1(5)}\end{array}\right]}={\left[\begin{array}{l}{-7}\\ {4}\\ {-1}\end{array}\right]}
$$
Then $\mathbf{u}\cdot A^T\mathbf{v} = (-1)(-7) + (2)(4) + (4)(-1) = 7 + 8 - 4 = 11$.
Thus, $A\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{u}\cdot A^T\mathbf{v}$ is verified.

::: {.notes}
This example numerically confirms the important identity $A\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{u}\cdot A^T\mathbf{v}$.
Understanding this relationship is key for advanced topics like singular value decomposition and eigenvalue problems.

## Application: ISBN Check Digits
The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) uses a check digit based on the dot product.

-   An older 10-digit ISBN (e.g., 0-471-15307-9) consists of 9 data digits and a 10th check digit.
-   Let $\mathbf{b} = (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_9)$ be the first nine digits.
-   Let $\mathbf{a} = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)$.
-   The check digit $c$ is the remainder when $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b}$ is divided by 11.
    -   If $c=10$, it's written as 'X'.

**Example:** ISBN 0-471-15307-9

$\mathbf{b} = (0, 4, 7, 1, 1, 5, 3, 0, 7)$

$\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{b} = (1)(0) + (2)(4) + (3)(7) + (4)(1) + (5)(1) + (6)(5) + (7)(3) + (8)(0) + (9)(7)$

$= 0 + 8 + 21 + 4 + 5 + 30 + 21 + 0 + 63 = 152$

$152 \div 11 = 13$ with a remainder of $9$. So, $c=9$.

::: {.notes}
This is a real-world application of the dot product for error detection.
This algorithm ensures that single-digit errors or transpositions of adjacent digits can be detected.
This concept of error detection and correction is vital in digital communication and data storage in ECE.
