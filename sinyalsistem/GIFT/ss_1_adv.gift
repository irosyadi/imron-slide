::Finite_Power_Signal_Energy::If a signal has finite average power (\\( P_\{\infty\} > 0\\)), what can be concluded about its total energy (\\(E_\{\infty\}\\)) over an infinite interval? {
=Its total energy must be infinite.
~Its total energy must be zero.
~Its total energy can be any finite positive value.
~Its total energy is undefined.
}

::Independent_Variable_Generality::While often referred to as "time," what other physical quantities can the independent variable in a signal represent? {
=Spatial variables like brightness across an image, depth in geophysics, or altitude in meteorological investigations.
~Only time as a universal constant.
~Only voltage or current.
~Only integer values related to demographic studies.
}

::Combined_Transformations_Order::When performing a combined transformation of the independent variable of the form \\( x(\alpha t + \beta) \\), what is the recommended systematic order of operations to obtain the transformed signal from \\( x(t) \\)? {
=First delay or advance by \\( \beta \\), then perform time scaling and/or time reversal by \\( \alpha \\).
~First perform time scaling and/or time reversal by \\( \alpha \\), then delay or advance by \\( \beta \\).
~The order does not matter for combined transformations.
~Only one operation (shift or scale/reverse) can be applied at a time.

::Even_Part_Formula::The even part of a continuous-time signal \\( x(t) \\), denoted as \\( \mathcal\{Ev\} (x(t)) \\), is given by which formula? {
