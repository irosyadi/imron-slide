## Chapter 3: Euclidean Vector Spaces

The Geometric Foundation of Signals and Fields 📐

### 3.1 Vectors in 2-Space, 3-Space, and n-Space

A **vector** is an object with both **magnitude** and **direction**. We represent it as an ordered list of numbers (an n-tuple).

$\vec{v} = (v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$

**In Electrical Engineering:**
* A DC voltage and current can be a vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$: $(V, I)$.
* An electric field at a point has 3 components: $\vec{E} = (E_x, E_y, E_z)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
* A digital audio signal is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $n$ is the number of samples. Each component is the amplitude at a point in time.

**Vector Operations:**
* **Addition:** $\vec{u} + \vec{v} = (u_1+v_1, u_2+v_2, \dots, u_n+v_n)$ (Tip-to-tail rule)
* **Scalar Multiplication:** $k\vec{v} = (kv_1, kv_2, \dots, kv_n)$ (Stretches or shrinks the vector)

---

### 3.2 Norm, Dot Product, and Distance

These tools let us measure vectors and the relationships between them.

**Norm (or Magnitude):** The "length" of a vector.  
$\|\vec{v}\| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \dots + v_n^2}$
* **EE Link**: This is directly related to the **power** of a signal or the magnitude of a phasor in AC circuits. The RMS value of a discrete signal is proportional to its norm!

**Dot Product:** An algebraic operation with huge geometric significance.  
$\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + \dots + u_nv_n = \|\vec{u}\|\|\vec{v}\|\cos\theta$
* **EE Link**: Measures "similarity". Used in communications for **matched filtering** to detect if a received signal matches a known template. $W = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{d}$ (Work = Force dot Displacement).

**Distance:** The distance between two vectors is the norm of their difference.  
$d(\vec{u}, \vec{v}) = \|\vec{u} - \vec{v}\|$

---

### 3.3 Orthogonality

Two vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are **orthogonal** if their dot product is zero.  
$\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = 0 \implies \cos\theta = 0 \implies \theta = 90^\circ$

They are perpendicular! :right_angle:

**This is one of the most important concepts in EE!**  
Orthogonality means independence or non-interference.

* **Communications**: In Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), we send two different data streams on sine and cosine carrier waves. These carriers are orthogonal, so they don't interfere with each other, doubling the data rate!  
    $\int_0^{2\pi} \sin(t)\cos(t) dt = 0$
* **Fourier Analysis**: Decomposing a complex signal into a sum of simple, orthogonal sine and cosine waves.

### Application: Orthogonal Projection

Projection finds the "shadow" that one vector casts onto another.

The projection of vector $\vec{u}$ onto vector $\vec{a}$ is:  
$\text{proj}_{\vec{a}}\vec{u} = \frac{\vec{u} \cdot \vec{a}}{\|\vec{a}\|^2} \vec{a}$

**Orthogonal Decomposition:**  
Any vector $\vec{u}$ can be broken into two orthogonal parts:
1. A component parallel to $\vec{a}$ ($\vec{w}_1 = \text{proj}_{\vec{a}}\vec{u}$)
2. A component orthogonal to $\vec{a}$ ($\vec{w}_2 = \vec{u} - \vec{w}_1$)

```language-plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
scale 2
' Define vectors as arrows
"0" <--> "a" : <color:blue><b>a</b>
"0" <--> "u" : <color:red><b>u</b>
"0" <--> "w1" : <b>w_1 = proj_a(u)</b>
"w1" <--> "u" : <color:green><b>w_2 = u - w_1</b>

' Add labels
label "Origin (0)" as 0 at (0,0)
label "" as a at (3,0)
label "" as u at (2,1.5)
label "" as w1 at (2,0)

' Draw a right angle symbol
"w1" -[hidden]right- "u"
@enduml
```

**EE Application**: This is the basis for **noise cancellation** and the Gram-Schmidt process for creating orthogonal signal sets.

### 3.4 The Geometry of Linear Systems

We can view a system of linear equations geometrically. For a 2x2 system:  
$a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 = b_1$  
$a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 = b_2$

Each equation represents a **line** in the plane. The solution to the system is the **intersection point** of these lines.

* **One Solution**: Lines intersect at a single point.
* **No Solution**: Lines are parallel and distinct.
* **Infinite Solutions**: Lines are identical (coincident).

This idea extends to higher dimensions:
* In $\mathbb{R}^3$, each linear equation is a **plane**. The solution is the intersection of planes (a point, a line, or a plane).
* In $\mathbb{R}^n$, each equation is a **hyperplane**. The solution is their common intersection.

### 3.5 Cross Product (for $\mathbb{R}^3$ only!)

The cross product of two vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ produces a new vector $\vec{u} \times \vec{v}$ that is **orthogonal** to both $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$.

$$
\vec{u} \times \vec{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \end{vmatrix} = (u_2v_3-u_3v_2)\mathbf{i} - (u_1v_3-u_3v_1)\mathbf{j} + (u_1v_2-u_2v_1)\mathbf{k}
$$

The magnitude is $\|\vec{u} \times \vec{v}\| = \|\vec{u}\|\|\vec{v}\|\sin\theta$, which is the area of the parallelogram formed by $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$.

The direction is given by the **Right-Hand Rule**.

### Cross Product in Electromagnetism

The cross product is not just a mathematical curiosity; it's the language of electromagnetism.

**Lorentz Force Law:** The force on a charge $q$ moving with velocity $\vec{v}$ through electric field $\vec{E}$ and magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is:  
$\vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})$  
The magnetic force component is always perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field. This is why magnetic fields make charged particles move in circles!

**Maxwell's Equations (Curl forms):**  
$\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}$  
$\nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 (\vec{J} + \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t})$  
The "curl" operator ($\nabla \times$) is a generalized cross product. It's fundamental to understanding how changing E-fields create B-fields and vice-versa, which is the basis for **radio waves, antennas, and all wireless technology**. 📡
