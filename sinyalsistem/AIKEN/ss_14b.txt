The discrete-time unit step \(u[n]\) can be expressed as the running sum of the unit sample \(\delta[m]\). Which equation represents this relationship?
A. \( u[n] = \sum_{m=0}^{n} \delta[m] \)
B. \( u[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{n} \delta[m] \)
C. \( u[n] = \delta[n] + \delta[n-1] \)
D. \( u[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta[m] \)
ANSWER: B
According to the sampling property, if \(x[n]\) is any discrete-time signal, what is the product \(x[n]\delta[n-n_0]\) equivalent to?

B. \( x[n_0]\delta[n] \)
C. \( x[n_0]\delta[n-n_0] \)
D. \( x[n]\delta[n] \)
ANSWER: C
The course describes the unit impulse as an idealization. Which of the following best characterizes this idealization?
A. A pulse with infinite duration but zero amplitude.
B. A pulse whose exact shape and duration do not matter for system response, only its peak value.
C. A pulse that is "short enough" such that only its area primarily affects the system's response.
D. A signal that can be perfectly generated by any real physical system.
ANSWER: C
When differentiating a continuous-time signal that has a jump discontinuity (like in Example 1.7), what does this discontinuity give rise to in the derivative?
A. A continuous ramp function.
B. A zero value in the derivative at that point.
C. An impulse located at the point of discontinuity, with area equal to the size of the discontinuity.
D. A sine wave at the point of discontinuity.
ANSWER: C
In Chapter 2, unit impulse signals will be shown to act as what for the construction and representation of other signals?
