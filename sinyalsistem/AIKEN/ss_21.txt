How is any discrete-time signal \(x[n]\) typically represented in terms of impulses?
A. As a product of impulses and exponents.
B. As a sequence of individual, scaled, and time-shifted impulses.
C. As a continuous integral of impulse functions.
D. As a sum of constant values only.
ANSWER: B
For a linear system, if an input \(x[n]\) is expressed as a linear combination of shifted unit impulses, how is its output \(y[n]\) obtained?
A. By taking the derivative of the input.
B. By summing the system's responses to each of the individual scaled and shifted impulses.
C. By multiplying the input signal by a constant.
D. By directly subtracting the impulse response from the input.
ANSWER: B
What single signal completely characterizes a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) discrete-time system?
A. Its response to a unit step function.
B. Its frequency response.
C. Its input signal \(x[n]\).
D. Its unit impulse response \(h[n]\).
ANSWER: D
The expression \(y[n]=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} x[k] h[n-k]\) is commonly referred to by what name?
A. The discrete-time Fourier Transform.
B. The Z-transform.
C. The convolution sum.
D. The autocorrelation function.
ANSWER: C
What is the symbolic representation for the convolution of two sequences \(x[n]\) and \(h[n]\)?
A. \(y[n] = x[n] + h[n]\)
B. \(y[n] = x[n] \cdot h[n]\)
C. \(y[n] = x[n] * h[n]\)
D. \(y[n] = x[n] \div h[n]\)
ANSWER: C
When graphically evaluating the convolution sum \(y[n]=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} x[k] h[n-k]\), what transformation is applied to \(h[k]\) to obtain \(h[n-k]\)?
A. Only a time shift by \(n\).
B. Only a time reversal.
C. A time reversal followed by a time shift.
D. Scaling by \(n\).
ANSWER: C
To calculate a specific output value \(y[n]\) using the graphical method for convolution, one multiplies the sequences \(x[k]\) and \(h[n-k]\) at each \(k\) and then performs which operation on the products?
A. Differentiation.
B. Integration.
C. Summation.
D. Subtraction.
