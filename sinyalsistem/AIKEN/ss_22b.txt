How is the representation of continuous-time signals in terms of impulses developed, similar to the discrete-time case?
A. By using a product of scaled, time-shifted step functions.
B. By approximating the signal with a superposition of scaled and delayed pulses.
C. By directly calculating its Fourier series composition.
D. By applying a Laplace transform to the signal.
ANSWER: B
The continuous-time sifting property of the unit impulse allows a signal \(x(t)\) to be represented by which of the following expressions?
A. \(x(t) = \int_{0}^{t} x(\tau) d\tau\)
B. \(x(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) dt\)
C. \(x(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x(\tau) \delta(t-\tau) d\tau\)
D. \(x(t) = x(0)\delta(t)\)
ANSWER: C
The continuous-time sifting property interprets a signal \(x(t)\) as what?
A. A series of independent, unrelated values.
B. A sum (integral) of weighted, shifted impulses.
C. A complex exponential sequence.
D. A decomposition into sine and cosine waves.
ANSWER: B
What does the convolution integral fundamentally reveal about a continuous-time LTI system?
A. It characterizes the system completely by its input signal.
B. It describes the system's response to any arbitrary input in terms of its unit impulse response.
C. It shows the system's internal hardware components.
D. It determines the system's stability margin.
