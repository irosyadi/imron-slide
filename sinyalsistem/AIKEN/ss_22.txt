ANSWER: B
For a continuous-time system to be Linear Time-Invariant (LTI), how does its response \(h_\tau(t)\) to a time-shifted impulse \(\delta(t-\tau)\) relate to its unit impulse response \(h(t)\)?
A. \(h_\tau(t) = h(t) + \tau\)
B. \(h_\tau(t) = h(\tau) - t\)
C. \(h_\tau(t) = h(t-\tau)\)
D. \(h_\tau(t) = h(t)\)
ANSWER: C
Which of the following equations represents the output \(y(t)\) of a continuous-time LTI system with input \(x(t)\) and impulse response \(h(t)\)?
A. \(y(t) = x(t) \cdot h(t)\)
B. \(y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x(\tau) h(t-\tau) d\tau\)
C. \(y(t) = \frac{d}{dt} h(t)\)

ANSWER: B
The symbolic representation for the convolution integral of two continuous-time signals \(x(t)\) and \(h(t)\) is:
