What critical point should always be remembered about any model used in describing or analyzing a physical system?
A. Models are exact replicas of physical systems.
B. Analysis results are independent of the model's accuracy.
C. Any model represents an idealization, and the analysis is only as good as the model itself.
D. Models are primarily for theoretical study and have no practical relevance.
ANSWER: C
