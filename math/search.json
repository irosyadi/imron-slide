Right: Shifted parabola over [-h, h].\n\n\n(ii) Area under a generic parabola over \\([-h, h]\\):\nSuppose \\(Q^{*}(x) = Ax^{2} + Bx + C\\).\n\\(\\mathrm {A r e a} = \\int_ {- h} ^ {h} (A x ^ {2} + B x + C) d x = \\left[ \\frac{Ax^3}{3} + \\frac{Bx^2}{2} + Cx \\right]_{-h}^h\\)\n\\(= \\left(\\frac{Ah^3}{3} + \\frac{Bh^2}{2} + Ch\\right) - \\left(\\frac{A(-h)^3}{3} + \\frac{B(-h)^2}{2} + C(-h)\\right)\\)\n\\(= \\frac{Ah^3}{3} + \\frac{Bh^2}{2} + Ch - (-\\frac{Ah^3}{3} + \\frac{Bh^2}{2} - Ch) = \\frac{2Ah^3}{3} + 2Ch = \\frac{h}{3} (2 A h ^ {2} + 6 C)\\).\nWe express this area in terms of \\(y_0, y_1, y_2\\):\n\\(y _ {0} = A (- h) ^ {2} + B (- h) + C = A h ^ {2} - B h + C\\).\n\\(y _ {1} = A (0) ^ {2} + B (0) + C = C\\).\n\\(y _ {2} = A (h) ^ {2} + B (h) + C = A h ^ {2} + B h + C\\).\nFrom these, we have:\n\\(y_0 + y_2 = (Ah^2 - Bh + C) + (Ah^2 + Bh + C) = 2Ah^2 + 2C\\).\n\\(y_0 + y_2 - 2y_1 = (2Ah^2 + 2C) - 2C = 2Ah^2\\). And \\(6C = 6y_1\\).\nSubstitute \\(2Ah^2 = y_0 + y_2 - 2y_1\\) and \\(6C = 6y_1\\) into the area formula:\n\\[\n\\mathrm {A r e a} = \\frac {h}{3} ( (y_0 + y_2 - 2y_1) + 6y_1 ) = \\frac {h}{3} \\left(y _ {0} + 4 y _ {1} + y _ {2}\\right).\n\\]\nThis is the area under one parabola (over two subintervals).\n\nThe derivation, though a bit algebraic, shows how the formula for the area of a parabolic segment is derived. The clever part is expressing the coefficients A, B, C in terms of the y-values at the three points, which then simplifies to the iconic (1, 4, 1) pattern."

The setup is a right triangle, where the horizontal distance from the lamppost to the motorcycle is \\(x\\), the vertical height of the bridge is \\(h\\), and the diagonal distance from the police to the motorcycle is \\(y\\).\nThe first step is to establish the geometric relationship using the Pythagorean theorem. Then, we differentiate this equation implicitly with respect to time \\(t\\), because all these distances are changing over time. Remember that \\(h\\) is a constant, so its derivative is zero.\nAfter differentiating and solving for \\(x'(t)\\) (the motorcycle’s speed), we plug in the given values at the specific instant. It’s crucial to be consistent with units; converting meters to kilometers is necessary here. The negative sign for \\(y'(t_0)\\) indicates that the distance \\(y\\) is decreasing. The resulting negative sign for \\(x'(t_0)\\) means the motorcycle is moving in a direction that makes \\(x\\) decrease (i.e., towards the lamppost, from the police’s perspective, or away from a reference point on the road if \\(x\\) was increasing). The speed is the absolute value of the velocity.\nComparing the calculated speed with the speed limit allows us to answer the question. This problem beautifully illustrates how calculus can be used to solve practical problems encountered in daily life (or by traffic police!)."

The closest perfect cube to \\(7.99\\) is \\(8\\). So, we choose \\(a = 8\\).\n\nNow, we follow the steps for linearization:\n\nFind \\(f(a)\\): \\(f(8) = \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2\\).\nFind \\(f'(x)\\): \\(f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^{1/3}) = \\frac{1}{3}x^{(1/3) - 1} = \\frac{1}{3}x^{-2/3} = \\frac{1}{3x^{2/3}}\\).\nFind \\(f'(a)\\): \\(f'(8) = \\frac{1}{3(8)^{2/3}} = \\frac{1}{3(\\sqrt[3]{8})^2} = \\frac{1}{3(2)^2} = \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 4} = \\frac{1}{12}\\).\nForm the linearization \\(L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)\\):\n\\(L(x) = 2 + \\frac{1}{12}(x - 8)\\).\nApproximate \\(\\sqrt[3]{7.99}\\):\nUse \\(x = 7.99\\).\n\\(\\sqrt[3]{7.99} \\approx L(7.99) = 2 + \\frac{1}{12}(7.99 - 8) = 2 + \\frac{1}{12}(-0.01)\\).\n\\(L(7.99) = 2 - \\frac{0.01}{12} = 2 - \\frac{1}{1200} \\approx 2 - 0.0008333 = 1.9991667\\).\n(Actual value \\(\\sqrt[3]{7.99} \\approx 1.9991663...\\))\n\n\nThis example further reinforces the strategy for using linearization. The first crucial step is always to identify the function \\(f(x)\\) and the nearby point \\(a\\) that will simplify your calculations.\nHere, since we want to approximate a cube root, \\(f(x) = x^{1/3}\\) is the natural choice. The number \\(7.99\\) is very close to \\(8\\), which is a perfect cube, making \\(a=8\\) an ideal point.\nOnce \\(f(x)\\) and \\(a\\) are chosen, the rest is mechanical: find \\(f(a)\\), find \\(f'(x)\\), evaluate \\(f'(a)\\), construct the linearization \\(L(x)\\), and then plug in the value you want to approximate. The arithmetic can be done by hand, and the result is a very good approximation. This method is a testament to the power of derivatives in practical estimation."

When finding \\(f'(t)\\), we encounter both a singular point (where \\(f'(t)\\) is undefined, here at \\(t=0\\)) and a stationary point (where \\(f'(t)=0\\), here at \\(t=2\\)). Both are important candidates for extrema.\nThen, we evaluate the function at these critical points and at the endpoints of the interval (\\(t=-1\\) and \\(t=8\\)). This gives us a list of potential maximum and minimum values.\nFinally, we compare all these function values. The largest value is the global maximum, and the smallest is the global minimum. Notice that the maximum occurs at a stationary point, and the minimum occurs at an endpoint in this example. This highlights why checking both critical points and endpoints is crucial."

If plugging in ‘a’ makes both numerator and denominator zero, then (x-a) must be a factor of both.\nIn Example 4.9.2, factoring makes the common (x+2) factor explicit. Since we’re looking at a limit as x approaches -2, not at -2, we can cancel (x+2) as long as x is not exactly -2. After cancellation, the new function is identical to the original everywhere except at x=-2, but it is now continuous at x=-2, allowing direct substitution.\nExample 4.9.3 demonstrates the same principle with higher-degree polynomials. If you have trouble factoring, remember the Factor Theorem: if P(a)=0, then (x-a) is a factor of P(x). You can then use polynomial long division or synthetic division to find the other factors."

The conjugate simply flips the sign between the two terms (e.g., the conjugate of (A - B) is (A + B)).\nWhen you multiply an expression by its conjugate, you use the difference of squares formula, (A-B)(A+B) = A^2 - B^2. This eliminates the square root from that part of the expression, often leading to a simplification that allows cancellation of the problematic (x-a) term.\nIn the example, after rationalizing, we found a common factor (x-1) (or (1-x)) that could be canceled, leading to a function that is continuous at x=1, allowing direct substitution.

The \\(\\sin(1/x^2)\\) part oscillates wildly near zero, so its limit does not exist. This means we cannot use the product rule for limits directly. However, we know that sine functions are always bounded between -1 and 1. By multiplying this inequality by \\(x^2\\) (which is non-negative), we create two new bounding functions, \\(-x^2\\) and \\(x^2\\). Both of these functions clearly go to 0 as \\(x\\) goes to 0. Therefore, the function in the middle must also go to 0."

Multiplying infinity by a positive constant yields infinity, while multiplying by a negative constant results in negative infinity. And one divided by infinity is zero.\nThe examples illustrate these rules:\n\nFor (tan x + 2 sin x), tan x goes to positive infinity, and 2 sin x goes to a finite value. Their sum is positive infinity.\nFor (-3 tan x sin x), tan x goes to positive infinity, but -3 sin x goes to a negative finite value (-3). Their product is negative infinity.\nFor x / tan x, the numerator approaches a finite value, and the denominator approaches negative infinity. This is equivalent to multiplying the numerator by 1/denominator, where 1/denominator approaches 0. So the overall limit is 0.\n\nThese rules are essential for analyzing functions near vertical asymptotes and understanding how different parts of an expression contribute to its infinite behavior."

It states that any power of ‘1/x’ (where the exponent is positive) will approach zero as ‘x’ goes to positive or negative infinity. This is because the denominator grows infinitely large, making the fraction infinitesimally small.\nPart (b) extends this to fractional exponents (roots), with a caveat for negative infinity: for even roots (like square roots), the base must be non-negative. So, for \\(\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} 1/x^{m/n}\\) to be defined and 0, ‘n’ must be an odd integer to allow negative x values.\nThese basic results are the building blocks for evaluating limits of rational functions and other more complex expressions at infinity."

As ‘x’ approaches infinity, all these terms (like 1/x, 4/x^2, etc.) approach zero, leaving only the constant terms or the coefficients of the highest powers.\nIn Example 4.12.3, the highest power in the denominator is \\(x^2\\). After dividing, all terms in the numerator and denominator except for the constant ‘1’ in the denominator go to zero, resulting in a limit of 0. This means the x-axis (y=0) is a horizontal asymptote.\nIn Example 4.12.4, the highest power in the denominator is \\(x^3\\). After dividing, the only remaining non-zero terms are the coefficients of \\(x^3\\) in the numerator and denominator, which are 1 and 7, respectively. The limit is 1/7. This means y=1/7 is a horizontal asymptote.\nThis method effectively compares the growth rates of the numerator and denominator polynomials."

This is a very useful fact because it means for any point in their domain, their limit is simply their function value.\nFurthermore, continuity is “preserved” under basic arithmetic operations and composition, similar to limit laws.\n\nThe sum, difference, product, and quotient (with non-zero denominator) of continuous functions are also continuous.\nThe composition of continuous functions is also continuous. This is extremely powerful for understanding complex functions, as it means if you chain together continuous functions, the result will also be continuous (within its domain).\n\nThe examples illustrate how to apply these properties. For instance, a rational function where the numerator is a composite of continuous functions and the denominator is also a continuous function (and not zero) will be continuous. This greatly simplifies the task of determining continuity."

If a continuous function has different signs at the endpoints of an interval, then it must cross the x-axis (where y=0) at least once within that interval. This is very useful for showing the existence of roots, even if we can’t easily find them algebraically.\nExample 4.14.2 beautifully illustrates this.

It has a global maximum at f(0)=1. However, as x approaches 0 from the left, f(x) approaches 0, but never actually reaches it. So, there is no smallest value, meaning no global minimum.

One-sided limits are crucial for understanding this approach from different directions, and they are the building blocks for the overall limit. Infinite limits describe “blow-up” behavior (vertical asymptotes), and limits at infinity describe long-term trends (horizontal asymptotes).\nSecondly, continuity ties the concept of limits to function values.

The Limit Laws are your basic arithmetic for limits. Techniques like factoring and rationalization are your algebraic tools for tricky cases like 0/0.

We are not interested in what happens at x equals 2, but what happens near 2.\nGraphically: If you trace the graph of ‘y = x-squared’, as you move your finger along the x-axis towards 2, from both the left and the right, your finger on the y-axis will approach 4.

This is a key distinction between function value and limit.\n\n\n\n\nThis example highlights a crucial aspect of limits: the limit doesn’t care about what happens at the point, only what happens around it.\nFor ‘f(x) = (1 - x^2) / (1 - x)’, direct substitution of x=1 leads to 0/0, which means the function is undefined at x=1. This creates a “hole” in the graph.\nHowever, if we look at values of x very close to 1, both slightly greater than 1 and slightly less than 1, we observe a clear pattern: the function values are getting closer and closer to 2. This suggests that the limit as x approaches 1 is 2.\nWe can actually simplify this function by factoring the numerator: (1 - x^2) = (1 - x)(1 + x). So, for x not equal to 1, f(x) = 1 + x. The limit of (1+x) as x approaches 1 is 1+1=2. This algebraic simplification confirms our computational guess."

However, if we choose values such that 1/x is pi/2, 5pi/2, 9pi/2, the sine will be 1. And if 1/x is 3pi/2, 7pi/2, the sine will be -1. As x approaches 0, 1/x grows infinitely large, causing the sine function to cycle through all values between -1 and 1 infinitely many times.\nGraphically: The image clearly shows this erratic oscillation. The graph literally cannot be drawn near x=0 as a continuous line to a single point. It’s impossible to pick one y-value that the function “approaches”.\nThis means there is no unique ‘L’ that ‘f(x)’ approaches, and therefore, the limit does not exist. This is a very important concept to grasp: just because a function is defined near a point doesn’t guarantee a limit exists."

(b) For tan x, the tangent function is sin x / cos x. When cos x is zero (at pi/2, 3pi/2, etc.), the function becomes undefined and shoots off to infinity or negative infinity. (c) For ln x, its domain is x &gt; 0. As x approaches 0 from the right side, ln x goes to negative infinity.

These are intuitively clear.\nTheorem 4.5.2 provides rules for scalar multiplication, addition, and subtraction of functions. We can pull constants out of limits, and we can distribute the limit operator over sums and differences.\nThe examples illustrate how these rules are applied step-by-step. This systematic approach is the foundation for evaluating more complex limits. Remember, these laws are valid provided the individual limits on the right-hand side exist."

It states that the limit of a quotient of two functions is the quotient of their limits, provided that the limit of the denominator is not zero. This is a critical condition; if the denominator’s limit is zero, we cannot use this law directly, and other techniques might be needed.\nThe examples illustrate the application of these laws.

You can just plug in the value!\nFor rational functions (a ratio of two polynomials), you can also substitute ‘a’ directly, but only if the denominator is not zero at ‘a’. This is a crucial condition. If the denominator is zero, direct substitution leads to an indeterminate form (like 0/0) or an infinite limit (like L/0), and other techniques are required.\nThe warning about substitution failing is very important to remember.

The ability to substitute directly is a hallmark of continuous functions. If a function is continuous at a point, its limit at that point is simply its function value at that point.

So, if you want to find the limit of ‘sin x’ as x approaches pi/2, it’s just ‘sin(pi/2) = 1’. No need for complex limit calculations.\nHowever, it’s important to be mindful of the domains. For ‘ln x’, it’s continuous only for positive x values. For ‘tan x’, it’s continuous everywhere except where cosine is zero (i.e., at odd multiples of pi/2), which are its vertical asymptotes.\nUnderstanding the continuity of these basic functions simplifies many limit problems and forms a building block for understanding more complex function behavior."

The ability to swap the limit and the function operation is precisely what continuity allows.\nThe example shows the practical application: because each individual term in the expression is continuous at x=1, their sum/difference is also continuous. This means we can evaluate the limit by simply plugging in x=1, simplifying the calculation significantly."

However, the converse isn’t always true. A function can have a tangent even if its derivative doesn’t exist as a finite number. This happens with vertical tangents.\nConsider \\(f(x) = x^{1/3}\\) (the cube root function). At \\(x=0\\), if we compute the limit for the derivative, we find it goes to infinity. This means the function is not differentiable at \\(x=0\\) in the usual sense (it doesn’t have a finite slope). Yet, if you visualize the graph, there’s clearly a vertical tangent line at the origin. The slope is infinite, which isn’t a finite number, so the derivative doesn’t “exist” as a number.\nThis example illustrates an important nuance. Differentiability requires a finite limit for the slope."

Intuitively, if a function’s value never changes, its rate of change is zero. The formal definition confirms this: the difference \\(f(x+h) - f(x)\\) will always be zero, so the limit is zero.\nNext, the power rule for positive integer exponents. This is incredibly useful! The proof involves the binomial expansion, where after cancelling the \\(x^n\\) terms, every remaining term in the numerator has an \\(h\\). Dividing by \\(h\\) leaves us with \\(nx^{n-1}\\) plus terms that still have \\(h\\) and go to zero as \\(h \\to 0\\).

We start with the definition of differentiability and work towards the definition of continuity.\nHowever, it’s crucial to remember that the reverse is not true! A function can be continuous but not differentiable. Our example of \\(f(x)=|x|\\) at \\(x=0\\) is a perfect illustration: it’s continuous (you can draw it without lifting your pen), but it’s not differentiable because of the sharp corner.\nThe corollary simply states that if a function has a jump, hole, or asymptote (i.e., it’s not continuous), then it definitely can’t be differentiable there.

Since the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value all agree, \\(f\\) is continuous.\nNext, we find the derivatives of each piece for \\(x&gt;1\\) and \\(x&lt;1\\).

So, we can include \\(x=1\\) in the domain of the \\(3x^2\\) part of the derivative, or specifically state \\(f'(1)=3\\).

These are also fundamental derivatives that should be memorized, especially arcsin, arccos, and arctan.\nLet’s look at the proof for \\(\\arcsin x\\). We set \\(y = \\arcsin x\\), which implies \\(\\sin y = x\\). Now we differentiate implicitly with respect to \\(x\\). The derivative of \\(\\sin y\\) is \\(\\cos y \\frac{dy}{dx}\\), and the derivative of \\(x\\) is 1. Solving for \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) gives us \\(1/\\cos y\\).\nTo express this in terms of \\(x\\), we use the Pythagorean identity \\(\\sin^2 y + \\cos^2 y = 1\\). Since \\(\\sin y = x\\), we have \\(\\cos^2 y = 1 - x^2\\), so \\(\\cos y = \\pm \\sqrt{1-x^2}\\). Because the range of \\(\\arcsin x\\) is \\((-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)\\), \\(\\cos y\\) must be positive, so we choose the positive square root. Substituting this back gives the desired derivative.\nThe other inverse trigonometric derivatives can be derived similarly. It’s good practice to try to derive the derivative of \\(\\arctan x\\) yourself using implicit differentiation."

    "text": "5.8 Mean Value Theorem\nThe Mean Value Theorem (MVT) is a fundamental theorem that connects the average rate of change of a function over an interval to its instantaneous rate of change at some point within that interval.\nTheorem 5.8.1 (Rolle’s Theorem):\nLet \\(f\\) be continuous on the closed interval \\([a, b]\\) and differentiable on the open interval \\((a, b)\\). If \\(f(a) = f(b)\\), then there is at least one point \\(c\\) in \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(f'(c) = 0\\).\n(Geometrically: If a function starts and ends at the same height, and is smooth, its tangent must be horizontal somewhere in between.)\nTheorem 5.8.2 (The Mean Value Theorem):\nLet \\(f\\) be continuous on the closed interval \\([a, b]\\) and differentiable on the open interval \\((a, b)\\). Then there is (at least one point) \\(c\\) in \\((a, b)\\) such that \\[\n\\frac {f (b) - f (a)}{b - a} = f ^ {\\prime} (c).\n\\]\n(Geometrically: There is a point \\(c\\) where the tangent line is parallel to the secant line connecting \\((a, f(a))\\) and \\((b, f(b))\\).)\n\nThe Mean Value Theorem is one of the most significant results in calculus. It’s an “existence” theorem, meaning it guarantees that something exists, even if it doesn’t tell you how to find it.\nRolle’s Theorem is a special case of the MVT. It says that if a function is continuous and differentiable, and has the same value at two endpoints, then there must be at least one point in between where the derivative is zero (a horizontal tangent). Think of it as reaching a peak or a valley if you start and end at the same elevation.\nThe Mean Value Theorem generalizes this. It states that if a function satisfies the conditions of continuity and differentiability on an interval, then there is at least one point \\(c\\) within that interval where the instantaneous rate of change (\\(f'(c)\\)) is equal to the average rate of change over the entire interval (\\(\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\\)). Geometrically, this means there’s a tangent line parallel to the secant line connecting the endpoints. This theorem is crucial for many proofs in calculus, including some of the upcoming theorems about function behavior."

This is a common type of problem in bounding errors or changes in systems.\nThe second example shows how MVT can be used for estimation, similar to linearization but providing an interval for the approximation rather than a single value. To estimate \\(\\sqrt[3]{65}\\), we choose a nearby point where the cube root is easily calculated (\\(x=64\\)). Applying MVT gives us an expression for \\(\\sqrt[3]{65}\\) involving \\(f'(x_0)\\) for some \\(x_0\\) between 64 and 65. By bounding \\(f'(x_0)\\) (since \\(x_0\\) is between 64 and 65, we know \\(x_0^{2/3}\\) must be greater than \\(64^{2/3}\\)), we can create an interval within which \\(\\sqrt[3]{65}\\) must lie. This provides a rigorous way to estimate values and bound their uncertainty."

However, other indeterminate forms can often be cleverly rewritten as quotients.\nFor \\(0 \\cdot \\infty\\), like \\(\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} x \\ln x\\), the trick is to move one of the factors to the denominator as its reciprocal. For example, \\(x \\ln x = \\frac{\\ln x}{1/x}\\). This transforms it into an \\(\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}\\) form, allowing us to apply L’Hospital’s Rule. We then proceed with the differentiation and evaluation of the limit.\nFor forms like \\(0^0\\), \\(1^\\infty\\), or \\(\\infty^0\\), the strategy involves using logarithms. By taking the natural logarithm, we convert the exponential form into a product, specifically \\(B \\ln A\\). This usually transforms the problem into a \\(0 \\cdot \\infty\\) form, which we then convert into a quotient, as in the previous case. For \\(\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} x^x\\), after taking the logarithm, we get \\(\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} x \\ln x\\), which we just solved. Since the exponential function is continuous, we can take the limit of the exponent first and then exponentiate the result. This leads us to the surprising result that \\(0^0 = 1\\) in this context. These examples show the power of algebraic manipulation combined with L’Hospital’s Rule for a broader range of limit problems."

If \\(f'(c)\\) exists, then \\(f'(c) = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nThis means that if a local extremum occurs at a point where the derivative exists, that point must be a stationary point (\\(f'(c)=0\\)). This is why we seek critical points when finding extrema!\n\n\n\n\nThe first derivative test for monotonicity is not just for graphing; it also helps us understand injectivity (one-to-one property) of functions. If a function is always increasing or always decreasing over an interval, it will never take on the same \\(y\\)-value twice, hence it is one-to-one.\nExample 5.9.4 uses this idea for \\(f(x) = \\sin x\\) on the restricted domain \\([-\\pi/2, \\pi/2]\\). Its derivative, \\(\\cos x\\), is positive on \\((-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)\\), which means \\(\\sin x\\) is strictly increasing there. This explains why \\(\\arcsin x\\) can be defined as a proper inverse function on this interval.\nFermat’s Theorem is a cornerstone of optimization. It tells us that if a function has a local maximum or minimum at a point where it’s differentiable, then the derivative must be zero at that point. Geometrically, this means the tangent line is horizontal. This theorem is why “finding where \\(f'(x)=0\\)” is the first step in many optimization problems. It identifies the “stationary points” where peaks and valleys (local extrema) can occur. It’s a necessary condition for local extrema, but not sufficient (i.e., \\(f'(c)=0\\) doesn’t guarantee an extremum, like at an inflection point)."

The domain is \\((0, \\infty)\\).\nApply First Derivative Test: Analyze the sign of \\(A'(r)\\) around the critical point to determine if it’s a local minimum. Since the function is decreasing before this point and increasing after, it’s a global minimum on this open interval.\nInterpret the result: The optimal radius is \\(r = (\\frac{V}{2\\pi})^{1/3}\\). Substituting this back into the height equation reveals a famous design principle: for a cylindrical can to minimize surface area for a given volume, its height should be equal to its diameter (\\(h=2r\\)). This is why many beverage cans have a height roughly twice their radius."

If the function goes from decreasing to increasing, it’s a local minimum. If it goes from increasing to decreasing, it’s a local maximum. If there’s no change in the derivative’s sign, then it’s neither. This test works even if the derivative doesn’t exist at the critical point (singular points).\nExample 5.10.7 (cube root of \\((x-1)^2\\)) clearly shows a change from negative to positive derivative, indicating a local minimum. This corresponds to a sharp “V” shape at \\(x=1\\).\nExample 5.10.8 (cube root of \\((x-1)\\)) is an interesting case. The derivative is always positive around \\(x=1\\). Even though \\(f'(1)\\) is undefined, the function continues to increase. This tells us there’s no local extremum; it’s an inflection point where the tangent is vertical.
